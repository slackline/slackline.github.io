Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is a piece of software that allows you to have persistent sessions on remote machines that
you connect to over SSH. It is ideal for running jobs which will take longer than you want to stay actively logged into
the remote machine allowing you to detach from the session and connect at a later job without having to actively
nackground jobs.
