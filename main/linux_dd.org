The ~dd~ command allows you to easily copy one drive to another.

If you have a drive, detected as ~/dev/sde~ that you want to back up to ~/dev/sdf~ then, after making sure none of the
partitions are mounted (and if they are using) simply run...
#+begin_example
dd if=/dev/sde of=/dev/sdf
#+end_example

* Options

** ~bs~ block size

This specifies the size of blocks to write in one go. ~bs=4M~ is a decent option that will speed up the process.

** ~status~

The ~status~ argument will show progress.


#+begin_example
dd if=/dev/sde of=/dev/sdf bs=4M status=progress
#+end_example
