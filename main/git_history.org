#+TITLE: Git History
#+FILETAGS: :git:history:grep:search:


Having a history of everything you've done on your code base is really useful as you can go back and search it with the
help of ~git grep~.

* Searching Git History

** Commit Messages

You can search commit messages for regular expressions using.

#+begin_src bash
git log --all --grep="<term>"
#+end_src

** Code

You can search all code for terms using the following.

#+begin_src bash
git grep <term> $(git rev-list --all)
#+end_src

...and it will show you what commits have lines that match ~<term>~.  This can take a long time if you've got a large
history/code base.

** Specific Commit

Search a specific commit for a term (after having identified it using the above) using

#+begin_src bash
git grep -n <term> <commit_hash>
#+end_src
