#+TITLE: SQL Linting
#+FILETAGS: :sql:linting:precommit:

[[id:55581960-395e-443c-bd5d-bc00c496b6ae][Linting]] your code is a great idea as it makes it readable to others and [[id:f7b43309-58ec-4f6d-8cc7-b53e64916742][Structured Query Language (SQL)]] is no
exception. Unfortunately there are many dialects, but not to worry, tools like [[https://www.sqlfluff.com][SQLFluff]] support many of these different
dialects and it has a [[id:c76767c4-2a49-42f8-a323-a6d6105e0bce][Pre-commit]] hook [[https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/production/pre_commit.html][available]] to make life that little bit easier.

* SQLFluff

There are two hooks available in SQLFluff ~sqlfluff-lint~ which reports linting errors and ~sqlfluff-fix~ which attempts
to fix errors in style.
