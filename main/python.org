[[https://www.python.org][Python]] is a general interpreted programming language. Its been around a while and is very mature, you should by all
accounts be using Python > 3.7 although you may encounter situations where Python 2.* is still in use, even though its
end-of-life was [[https://endoflife.date/python][2010-07-03]]. There are of course lots of [[id:73be660e-298f-4ccb-900c-215b86b3f4d5][Tips and Tricks]].

* Linting

Linting is the process of following a specific coding style. This has many advantages in that it makes the code easier
to read and understand and can remove duplication. For Python the original guide is [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/][PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code]]
and there are various extensions such as [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/][PEP 484 - Type Hints]] which expect type annotations to be applied. It can be
challenging to remember all of the rules though and so there are linters which work with your Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) to refactor your code on the fly applying the rules when saving a file so that code is consistently
structured before it goes out to peer-review.

+ [[https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/][Flake8: Your Tool For Style Guide Enforcement]]
+ [[http://mypy-lang.org/][mypy - Optional Static Typing for Python]]
+ [[https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][Black - the uncomprimising code formatter]]


You can also use the "AI" [[https://sourcery.ai/][Sourcery]] to "/Automatically Improve Python Code Quality/". For more on linting see [[id:55581960-395e-443c-bd5d-bc00c496b6ae][Linting]].

* Typing

Python is a "/dynamically typed language/" and this doesn't mean, as I first thought when I heard the term (having no
background in Computer Science!), that you type it interactively (that is the "/REPL/"!), rather it means that an object
can be of a given "type" (~string~, ~int~, ~float~, class types etc.) and this is determined at run-time and can change
on the fly.

Read more about [[id:3f19e1ef-e5c4-45f1-822f-8d4d834acdbd][Python Typing]].

* Testing

Testing is something I came across late in my programming adventure, but it is really something that should be learnt or
taught from the beginning as it has huge benefits as you progress through developing your code. It is so useful there is
even a popular paradigm of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development][Test-driven development]] whereby tests are written /before/ any code is written.

In Python there is the built-in [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html][unittest — Unit testing framework]] but a more popular one is [[id:3cca0dfd-0c82-4685-b9ed-6314f7c8b78f][Pytest]]


* Project Management

[[https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/][Hatch]] is a modern, extensible Python project manager that standardises the build system, eases publishing to PyPI and
helps with environment and version management.

Whilst Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of [[id:8da3c4d1-e3ef-40ec-b2bd-1d5685c8fa51][data structure]] is determined on the fly when
running code, the typing of arguments and their subsequent validation can be invaluable. This is achieved by adding [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html][type
hints]] to your code, typically whenever a new variable is defined, whether that is in the main body of code or in a
function/method definition. For the later it is also sensible to add a type hint as to the type of object(s) that are
returned.  The consistency of type hints can be checked using [[http://mypy-lang.org/][mypy]] and input can be validated on the fly by using
[[id:ba02ecdf-c35f-4deb-8308-28341922c096][pydantic]].

I found [[https://kobzol.github.io/rust/python/2023/05/20/writing-python-like-its-rust.html][Writing Python like its Rust]] a really insightful read and will be endeavour to use this as well as pydantic in
future work.

* Iterators and Generators

There is more to Python ~for~ loops than meets the eye because they actually use ~iterators~ all over the place. A good
article detailing all this is [[https://opensource.com/article/18/3/loop-better-deeper-look-iteration-python][Loop better: A deeper look at iteration in Python | Opensource.com]].
* Profiling

[[id:dd7c615f-cd8b-426d-aec0-cfd3803437cc][Python profiling]] can be leveraged to find where the bottlenecks are in your workflow and where things can be sped up.

* Community

I'm yet to come across anything like the [[id:e7011db4-16fc-4cde-bb81-4d172cb0db14][R community]] but many Python users are enthusiastic and happy to share their
code and wisdom, whether that is via [[https://www.reddit.com/r/python][/r/python]] or other places.
