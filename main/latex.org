[[https://www.latex.org][LaTeX]] is an amazing type-setting language built on top of the original TeX langage developed by Donald Knuth. It can be
used to produce all sorts of documents from scientific reports, beamer slides, curriculum viate, letters, business cards
and more. Thanks to integration with [[id:1db6158d-cb5d-4b73-b926-95e9c09f878b][RMarkdown]] you can take advantage of the array of markup in LaTeX when writing
literate documents in [[id:de9a18a7-b4ef-4a9f-ac99-68f3c76488e5][R]].

* Cleaning

LaTeX files can end up having a lot of clutter and potentially containing sensitive information (see [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03761][here]]). A useful
tool is [[https://github.com/google-research/arxiv-latex-cleaner][arxiv-latex-cleaner]] which attempts to remove clutter and comments from files prior to submission to [[https://arxiv.org/][arXiv]].
