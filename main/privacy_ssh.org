* Create Keys

#+begin_src
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519
#+end_src

Keep the private key on your server (or any other machine you wish to establish a ~ssh~ connection /from/) and place the
public key (that ends ~.pub~) on the remote server you wish connect /to/. Ideally you should add the public key to the
~~/.ssh/authorized_keys~ file in the format...

#+begin_src
ssh-ed25519 ########## <user>@<host>
#+end_src


* Server Configuration

Make the following changes to help improve security on your server.

- ~PermitRootLogin no~
- ~PasswordAuthentication no~ although only /after/ you have setup a user account and transferred keys.
- ~Port ###~ set the port on which connections are made to something other than the default (which is ~22~).
- ~X11Forwarding false~
