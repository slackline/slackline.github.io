* Pytest

As its web-page states [[https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/][pytest: helps you write better programs]].

Often when writing tests early on you might expect them to fail, you can use the ~@pytest.mark.xfail~ fixture to mark a
test as "expect to fail" and ~pytest~ will not halt and instead carry on with the rest of the tests.

** Configuration

You can configure pytest within a projects directory via one of a choice of files ~setup.cfg~ is sufficient for simple
use cases but its recommended more complex configurations are made via ~pyproject.toml~ or ~XXX~.

** Documentation Tests

I came across an article advocating [[https://simonwillison.net/2018/Jul/28/documentation-unit-tests/][Documentation unit tests]] and showing one approach to testing documentation.
