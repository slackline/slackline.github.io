* Search NixOS for configuration

The site [[https://search.nixos.org/][search.nixos.org]] doesn't just list [[https://search.nixos.org/packages][packages]], there is the option to search [[https://search.nixos.org/options][NixOS options]] too. It lists all of
the modules configuration and you can search it for sub-options and examples. For example, you want to know what
configuration options are available for the [[id:a1b78518-31e8-4fd3-a36f-d8f152832138][ZSH]] shell under NixOS, search for [[https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=24.11&show=programs.zsh.autosuggestions.async&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=programs.zsh][~programs.zsh~]] and you get a list of all
the options that are available, click on one and you can expand each and see a succinct example of its usage.

* Switching to old generations and deleting new ones

If you find an update or change to your system is unstable and want to revert to an old one you can do so easily with
the following (where ~14~ is the working generation and ~15~ is the broken one to be removed)

#+begin_src
nix-env --list-generations
nix-env --switch-generation 14
nix-env --delete-generation 15
#+end_src
