#+TITLE: Emacs Elfeed
#+DATE: <2022-12-28 Wed 10:56>
#+FILETAGS: emacs:config:elfeed

* Configuration

#+INCLUDE: "~/.config/emacs/settings/elfeed-settings.el" example emacs-lisp

* Usage

I use [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][elfeed-org]] to simplify defining the feeds I want to follow. This means I keep an org-file with the feeds I want to
follow.

#+INCLUDE: ~/org/elfeed.org~ example orgmode

I want to be able to read my RSS feeds from anywhere and so I've configured ~elfeed-web-start~ to load after loading
~simple-httpd~ (see above configuration). I also have a timer set to run at 07:00 and 19:00 to run a custom command that
updates elfeed.  As a consequence I run Emacs as a daemon service on my VPS and can access the Elfeed web-page to view
my RSS feeds.
