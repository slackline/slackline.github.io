[[https://lineageos.org][LineageOS]] is one of the older [[id:2c46e54a-d704-4e7e-bca3-d8c3e042ab43][Android]] alternatives and forms the basis of many others (e.g. /e/OS/). It supports a wide
range of devices and is a great way of keeping old devices running, although not all devices are supported as it is
volunteer led (often you can find unofficial LineageOS versions on XDA forms, use at your own risk).

*ALWAYS* follow the official instructions when flashing ROMs to avoid data lost and bricking your device.
