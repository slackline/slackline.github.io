#+TITLE: Codeberg Pages

Codeberg Pages are another way to leverage [[id:284615e5-516f-4b04-a3d8-2a5ea9480f8e][Woodpecker CI]] but in this case they build and deploy static websites such as
[[id:9e8265ee-95d1-4218-90cd-74357aec1ea5][MkDocs]] or [[id:251b3ae4-4a5c-4c44-909a-dcbc0aef4b45][Quarto]].

I started with the [[https://codeberg.org/Codeberg-CI/examples/src/branch/main/Python/.woodpecker/mkdocs.yaml][Codeberg mkdocs.yaml]] template, I thought I might need to explicitly clone my repository but that
isn't  the case, it happens auto-magically in the first step of the pipeline when the image is initialised.


* Configuration

Woodpecker needs to be able to push to your repository in order to publish the pages. To do this you need to add a

* ReadTheDocs

An alternative is to off-load page hosting to [[https://readthedocs.org/][ReadTheDocs.org]]. If you use [[id:9e8265ee-95d1-4218-90cd-74357aec1ea5][MkDocs]] then the configuration of that requires
adding ~mkdocs.yml~ and deployment to ReadTheDocs requires add ~.readthedocs.yaml~ as [[https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/intro/mkdocs.html][documented]].

You may have additional dependencies required by ~mkdocs~ (typically defined in ~pyproject.toml~ for Python projects)
and so you should add a section which installs the requirements.

#+begin_src yaml
# Optional but recommended, declare the Python requirements required
# to build your documentation
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html
python:
    install:
        - method: pip
          path: ./
          extra_requirements:
              - docs
#+end_src
