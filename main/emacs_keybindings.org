#+TITLE: Emacs Key Bindings
#+FILETAGS: :emacs:keys:

Useful keybindings I am slowly trying to commit to memory, really helps to use [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] (now part of Emacs core) and
the ~helpful~ commands are useful too.

* Which Key

Which key tells you what the next key, or combination, will do, its invaluable as there are so many (which is why its
now part of Emacs Core).

** Prefix expansion

That said if a key is a prefix to another set of commands it doesn't, by default expand on what that is. I found a
useful [[https://gist.github.com/mmarshall540/a12f95ab25b1941244c759b1da24296d][Gist]] which shows how to add specific replacements and have adapted that.

See lines 29-61 (on writing) of the configuration.
