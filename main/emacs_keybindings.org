#+TITLE: Emacs Key Bindings
#+FILETAGS: :emacs:keys:

Useful keybindings I am slowly trying to commit to memory, really helps to use [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] (now part of Emacs core) and
the ~helpful~ commands are useful too.


* Key-bindings

You can show the key-bindings, global, major and minor, for a given buffer with ~C-h b~

** Global

|--------------+--------|
|              |        |

** Navigation

| ~C-p~        | Previous line                 |
| ~C-M-n~      | Forward a parentetical group  |
| ~C-M-p~      | Backward a parentetical group |
| ~M-S-Up~     | Move line up                  |

** Helpful

| Key Sequence | Action                                   |
|--------------+------------------------------------------|
| ~C-h b~      | Information on the current buffer        |
| ~C-h k~      | Find out what a key sequence is bound to |
| ~C-h m~      | Information on the current buffers modes |
| ~C-h v~      | Describe a variable                      |
| ~C-h x~      | Describe a command                       |


* Which Key

Which key tells you what the next key, or combination, will do, its invaluable as there are so many (which is why its
now part of Emacs Core).

** Prefix expansion

That said if a key is a prefix to another set of commands it doesn't, by default expand on what that is. I found a
useful [[https://gist.github.com/mmarshall540/a12f95ab25b1941244c759b1da24296d][Gist]] which shows how to add specific replacements and have adapted that.

See lines 29-61 (on writing) of the configuration.
