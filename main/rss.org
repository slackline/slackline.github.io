I used to use Google Reader to keep abreast of topics via RSS feeds. Alas Google killed it as it ruined their business
model of tracking people and serving up their ad-sponsored content. I tried a few alternative source but settled on
hosting my own [[https://freshrss.nshephard.dev/][FreshRSS feed]] using the [[id:f277da12-5d6d-46e3-a49c-7bda9254d469][FOSS]] software [[https://www.freshrss.org/][FreshRSS]]. It's great, and has bought me back to the joy of hosting
and reading blogs.
