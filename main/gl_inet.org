As with the GL-iNet hardware run [[id:0e6300c6-7025-4f45-820d-4d9da82b41a6][Linux]] under the hood. Specifically a modified version of [[id:0eca0cca-f5d0-4259-879b-b7f1844c3e90][OpenWrt]].

I've a couple of devices.

I bought this router on their early access but have never used it, only upgraded firmware. I keep it as a backup should
my main.

** Upgrade

+ [[https://dl.gl-inet.com/router/ax1800/stable][Official Firmware]]
+ [[https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4/interface_guide/upgrade/][Upgrade Instructions]]

WebUI has a panel for upgrades and auto-upgrade can be setup.

*** v3 > v4

Not backwards compatible so upgrades lose settings. Advice is to do a manual upgrade using the ~UBoot~ image available
from the Firmware page.

Password is reset to the default.

A great little pocket router which allows setting up a private and secure network on the go.
