#+TITLE: Codeberg Migration
#+FILETAGS: :codeberg:forge:git:github:gitlab:forgejo:

Migration is a very useful feature for moving existing repositories, I opted however to [[id:516bd2e7-bd0e-4daf-9122-7cf49a082398][mirror]] my repositories back straight-away.

* How to Migrate

1. Click on the ~+~ symbol at the top right and select /New Migration/.
2. Copy the ~https://~ URL for cloning from the existing forge and paste into the field on Codeberg
3. Add an Access Token generated on the forge you are migrating from (see below).
4. Select all tick-boxes (although I exclude Git LFS as I don't use this).
5. Optionally make the repository private.
6. Click on /Migrate repository/.

That its simple!

** Access Tokens

These allow you to bring the issues, pull requests, labels, milestones and releases over when migrating.

You should create an access token on the Forge you are migrating from.

*** GitLab

*** ForgeJo

1. Under /Settings > Applications/ generate a new token, I called mine ~codeberg-migration~.
2. Select whether the token has access to /Public only/ or /All (public, private and limited)/ repositories and
   organisations.
3. I selected 'Read' permissions for all API routes.
