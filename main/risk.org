Understanding what risk actually means is very useful for modern life, particularly as we are constantly bombarded with
information about how risky action x, y or z is. There are two ways of quantifying risk, absolute and relative, the
former is the most important and useful, but unfortunately the later is what is most commonly used in the media. When I
was first taught epidemiology we had a task about understanding the risk associated with living in areas close to large
amounts of bracken, which *doubles* your risk of colorectal cancer which sounds pretty drastic, unless you are aware
that the baseline risk of colorectal cancer is very low in the first place (from memory something like 1 in 100,000) and
so doubling it isn't that risky (2 in 100,000) *TODO* look this up and add citations.
