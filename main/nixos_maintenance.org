#+TITLE: NixOS - Maintenance
#+FILETAGS: :nixos:linux:maintenance:

Using the system invariable involves updating the configuration, whether that is the default
~/etc/nixos/configuration.nix~, [[id:c9eb0e6d-b152-487c-90d4-3786fcfd0889][Flakes]] or [[id:01336e19-dc8a-41ca-8534-6a790b39b1b6][HomeManager]]. If you're anything like me you won't get things write first time
and to avoid having innumerable boot options to choose from and wasting valuable hard-drive space you can rebuild the
system with ~test~ option rather than ~switch~ which builds and activates it but does not add it to the GRUB boot menu.

#+begin_src
nixos-rebuild test
#+end_src


* Garbage Collection

Over time the ~/nix/store~ will grow, this is because Nix is functional and packages are not upgraded in place, rather
new versions of packages are installed in a different location /within/ ~/nix/store~ this is what allows you to roll
back to earlier installs when things go wrong and your system isn't working. Its worth reading the [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Storage_optimization][Storage optimization]]
page.

NixOS comes with a /garbage collector/ which removes old, unreferenced packages and it can be run with
~nix-collect-garbage~. It has an associated ~systemd~ module that can be enabled/run with ~systemctl start
nix-gc.service~ but to enable this to run periodically in a declarative manner from your configuration add the following
to ~/etc/nixos/configuration.nix~. which will remove "garbage" older than 30 days once a week

#+begin_src
{
  nix = {
    gc = {
      automatic = true;
      dates = "weekly";
      options = "--delete-older-than 30d";
    }; end gc
  }; # end nix
}
#+end_src


This doesn't however remove old system configurations ("roots") and the ability to roll back to them. To remove these
you can run.

#+begin_src
nix-collect-garbage -d
#+end_src

You can also clear out old, identical files in the store and replace them with a single copy with.

#+begin_src
nix-store --optimise
#+end_src

Again this can be tedious having to remember to run this command and scheduling by ~cron~ doesn't fit with the NixOS
declarative philosophy. Unsurprisingly you can configure this option in ~/etc/nixos/configuration.nix~

#+begin_src
  ## Save space by enabling hard links in the nix store (not a default).
  ## Running the optimization once after enabling this setting by doing nix-store --optimise (can take a while). 50-100GB saved right thereâ€¦
  ## Source: https://github.com/novoid/nixos-config/blob/47829d10f5c5408e8e50c52767584e09c991996f/configuration.nix#L19
{
  nix = {
    ...
    optimise = {
      automatic = true;
      dates = ["07:16"];
    }; end optimise
  }; # end nix
}
  nix.settings.auto-optimise-store = true;
#+end_src

** ~/boot~

The boot partition has the potential to become full which blocks updates to kernels (see [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/23926][thread]]). As mentioned though it
is possible to set the option ~boot.loader.grub.configurationLimit~ to ensure that only a fixed number of kernel images
are installed/retained at any given time.

* Updating

#+begin_src
nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade
#+end_src


* Switching Channels

To switch channels to unstable you need to update the ~nix-channel~ for ~nixos~ and [[id:01336e19-dc8a-41ca-8534-6a790b39b1b6][NixOS - HomeManager]] if you are using
it.

#+begin_src
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable nixos
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update
nix-channel --list
nixos-rebuild switch [--impure]
#+end_src

To revert you back to a specific ~<version>~ you would...

#+begin_src
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-<version> nixos
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-<version>.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update
nix-channel --list
nixos-rebuild switch [--impure]
#+end_src
