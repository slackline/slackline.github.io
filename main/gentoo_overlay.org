#+TITLE: Gentoo Overlays
#+FILETAGS: :gentoo:linux:portage:

There are a number of [[https://repos.gentoo.org/][Gentoo Overlays]] which can be enabled with ~eselect repository~. This will list the available
repository which can be added with ~add <name>~, optionally setting the ~<sync-type>~  and ~<sync-url>~ there are
commands to ~enable~, ~disable~, ~list -i~ (installed) and ~remove~.


[[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman][Layman]] used to be a package for handling overlays but is now obsolete. These days everything is done via Git repos and
handled by ~eselect~


* Managing

To add an overlay

#+begin_src
eselect repository enable guru
#+end_src

* Personal

If you want a personal overlay the ~profiles/repo_name~ should be unique and match the entries in
~/etc/portage/repos.conf/*~.

* Overlays

Old or obsolete overlays I may find useful.

+ [[https://github.com/yemouu/moulay][moulay]] - used in the past as it had ~texlab~  a LaTeX Language Server.
