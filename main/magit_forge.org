#+TITLE: Magit Forge
#+FILETAGS: :magit:git:forge:github:gitlab:


You can configure Magit to work with forges such as [[id:52b4db29-ba21-4a8a-9b83-6e9a8dc02f41][GitHub]] and [[id:7cbd61f2-d6a5-4e67-af72-2a13a5e86faa][GitLab]] using the [[https://magit.vc/manual/forge.html][Forge]] package. Its a little tricky to
setup but you should read the [[https://magit.vc/manual/forge.html#Getting-Started][Getting Started]] instructions and if it doesn't work first time persevere and try again.

Once you've setup and configured Forge you can pull all issues and pull requests with ~M-x forge-pull~ or from a ~magit~
buffer use ~f n~. You can then create issues when the cursor is on the "~Issues~" section with ~N c i~ or similarly pull
requests (~N c p~). You can comment and edit existing topics, whether that is Issues or Pull Requests by hitting
~Return~ to view it and ~C-c C-e~ to edit a given section when the cursor is over that section.
