An extensions of [[id:9f72e8bd-2dbe-4a95-9517-c0c94bc995a0][Statistics]] Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses many methods to give the impression of human
intelligence. Its a tricky area, what defines "human intelligence" is a basic axiom that needs defining before it is
possible to define whether anything "artificial" can mimic it.

* Applications

** Code Generation

Notionally ChatGPT can be used to generate code samples such as [[https://twitter.com/jfernandez__/status/1599470590405976064][Shiny Apps]] but it's not perfect and typically results in
more bugs than a human might produce (although clearly no one has ever looked at my code!). [[https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned][StackOverflow have banned
ChatGPT]] answers for the time being, although I wonder if the poor quality is a reflection of the corpus within SO itself.

* API

There are [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]] [[id:ff8ee302-7518-4179-9bcb-63b13199f897][packages]] available for interacting with some of these services.

+ [[https://github.com/stuhlmueller/gpt.el][gpt]]
+ [[https://github.com/antonhibl/gptai][gptai]]
+ [[https://github.com/joshcho/ChatGPT.el][ChatGPT]] and built on it [[https://github.com/suonlight/ob-chatgpt][ob-chatgpt]] which allows you to query GPT-3 directly from within org-babel chunks and insert
  the ~RESULTS:~.

* Open Systems

One of the problems of systems like ChatGPT, Dall-E and Googles Bard is that they are closed source and services offered
(sometimes with APIs) by private companies. They control what data the system is trained on and how the model is built
and they can choose to retract their availability, particularly for free, at any point in time.

This is noted in the blog post [[https://dindi.garjola.net/ai-assistants.html][AI assistants in Emacs. Don't use ChatGPT. Help Open Science.]] which links to some
interesting projects such as the [[https://bigscience.huggingface.co/][BigScience Project]] and their [[https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom][Bloom]] model which can be connected to from [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]]. Tying in
with the need to open source aspect and the advantage it provides to not just software development but also AI research
is the article based on purportedly leaked by content from a Google employ at [[https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither][Google "We Have No Moat, And Neither Does
OpenAI"]].

* Ethics and Morals

** Moral Outsourcing

Something I first came across in the article [[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/29/rumman-chowdhury-interview-artificial-intelligence-accountability][‘I do not think ethical surveillance can exist’: by Rumman Chowdhury]] is the
idea that we absolve the humans involved in the development, implementation, deployment and use of AI when talking about
"bad algorithms". We should be aware that our choice of input data results in bias, we can choose not to use AI and
instead employ people to do jobs.
