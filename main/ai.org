An extensions of [[id:9f72e8bd-2dbe-4a95-9517-c0c94bc995a0][Statistics]] Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses many methods to give the impression of human
intelligence. Its a tricky area, what defines "human intelligence" is a basic axiom that needs defining before it is
possible to define whether anything "artificial" can mimic it.

* Applications

** Code Generation

Notionally ChatGPT can be used to generate code samples such as [[https://twitter.com/jfernandez__/status/1599470590405976064][Shiny Apps]] but it's not perfect and typically results in
more bugs than a human might produce (although clearly no one has ever looked at my code!). [[https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned][StackOverflow have banned
ChatGPT]] answers for the time being, although I wonder if the poor quality is a reflection of the corpus within SO itself.

* API

There are [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]] [[id:ff8ee302-7518-4179-9bcb-63b13199f897][packages]] available for interacting with some of these services.
