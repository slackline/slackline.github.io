#+TITLE: Artificial Intelligence
#+FILETAGS: :statistics:machinelearning:ai:

An extensions of [[id:9f72e8bd-2dbe-4a95-9517-c0c94bc995a0][Statistics]] Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses many methods to give the impression of human
intelligence. Its a tricky area, what defines "human intelligence" is a basic axiom that needs defining before it is
possible to define whether anything "artificial" can mimic it.

* Applications

** Code Generation

Notionally ChatGPT can be used to generate code samples such as [[https://twitter.com/jfernandez__/status/1599470590405976064][Shiny Apps]] but it's not perfect and typically results in
more bugs than a human might produce (although clearly no one has ever looked at my code!). [[https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned][StackOverflow have banned
ChatGPT]] answers for the time being, although I wonder if the poor quality is a reflection of the corpus within SO itself.

There are other issues relating to the licensing of such generated code as highlighted in [[https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/07/22/open-source-projects-reject-ai-code-over-copyright-concerns/][Open source projects reject AI
code over copyright concerns – Pivot to AI]]

* API

There are [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]] [[id:ff8ee302-7518-4179-9bcb-63b13199f897][packages]] available for interacting with some of these services.

+ [[https://github.com/stuhlmueller/gpt.el][gpt]]
+ [[https://github.com/antonhibl/gptai][gptai]]
+ [[https://github.com/joshcho/ChatGPT.el][ChatGPT]] and built on it [[https://github.com/suonlight/ob-chatgpt][ob-chatgpt]] which allows you to query GPT-3 directly from within org-babel chunks and insert
  the ~RESULTS:~.

* Prompt Engineering

+ [[https://www.promptingguide.ai/][Prompt Engineering Guide | Prompt Engineering Guide]]

* LLMs

Large Language Models are all the rage and a bit of a gimmick in my view.

Query WikiData using [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Request_a_query#Introducing_SpinachBot%21][SpinachBot]] to construct SPARQL queries.

You can also [[https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/10/llm_finetuning_guide/][An introduction to fine-tuning LLMs at home with Axolotl]]

* Open Systems

One of the problems of systems like ChatGPT, Dall-E and Googles Bard is that they are closed source and services offered
(sometimes with APIs) by private companies. They control what data the system is trained on and how the model is built
and they can choose to retract their availability, particularly for free, at any point in time.

This is noted in the blog post [[https://dindi.garjola.net/ai-assistants.html][AI assistants in Emacs. Don't use ChatGPT. Help Open Science.]] which links to some
interesting projects such as the [[https://bigscience.huggingface.co/][BigScience Project]] and their [[https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom][Bloom]] model which can be connected to from [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]]. Tying in
with the need to open source aspect and the advantage it provides to not just software development but also AI research
is the article based on purportedly leaked by content from a Google employ at [[https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither][Google "We Have No Moat, And Neither Does
OpenAI"]].

* What is Intelligence

Historically the Turing Test has been held up, perhaps inappropriately, as the /de facto/ means of assessing AI. This
has recently been called into question (see [[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq9356][The Turing Test and our shifting concetions of intelligence]])

* Ethics and Morals

** Accountability

Dennett writes that AI has the capacity to erode trust, a foundation on which society and governance is based on [[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/][The
Problem With Counterfeit People - The Atlantic]].


An excellent article by Meredith Whittaker on accountability of AI and "Big Tech" [[https://www.helmut-schmidt.de/aktuelles/detail/die-rede-der-zukunftspreistraegerin][Bundeskanzler-Helmut-Schmidt-Stiftung
2024]].

** Moral Outsourcing

Something I first came across in the article [[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/29/rumman-chowdhury-interview-artificial-intelligence-accountability][‘I do not think ethical surveillance can exist’: by Rumman Chowdhury]] is the
idea that we absolve the humans involved in the development, implementation, deployment and use of AI when talking about
"bad algorithms". We should be aware that our choice of input data results in bias, we can choose not to use AI and
instead employ people to do jobs.

** AI Now

An independent AI research institute that looks at the wider social implications of the discourse.

* Legal

These "tools" use huge amounts of often copyrighted data without permission.

Useful blog on legal aspects is [[https://chatgptiseatingtheworld.com/][Chat GPT Is Eating the World]].

* Regulation

Interesting commentary [[https://cyber.jotwell.com/products-liability-as-the-pragmatic-first-step-to-a-i-regulation/][Products Liability as the Pragmatic First Step to A.I. Regulation - Technology Law]] on the paper
[[https://cyber.jotwell.com/products-liability-as-the-pragmatic-first-step-to-a-i-regulation/][Products Liability as the Pragmatic First Step to A.I. Regulation - Technology Law]].

* Programming

* Replication Issues

Good blog post on the replication issues with "AI" at [[https://www.understandingai.org/p/i-got-fooled-by-ai-for-science-hypeheres][I got fooled by AI-for-science hype—here's what it taught me]] (see
