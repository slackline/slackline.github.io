#+NAME: Kitty
#+FILETAGS: :linux:kitty:terminal:

[[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty]] is a fast GPU accelerated terminal emulator. I like it and have used it for a number of years.

* Troubleshooting

** SSH Connections

You may find that a remote SSH doesn't support kitty and you encounter the error message...

#+begin_src bash
'xterm-kitty': unknown terminal type
#+end_src

This means that ~kitty~ isn't installed on the remote and it doesn't know how to handle connections from it. You can
however let the remote server know what capabilities your terminal emulator (i.e. ~kitty~) has using ~terminfo~. This
solution was found [[https://redgreen.no/2020/05/10/kitty-unknown-terminal-type.html][here]]. Run the following and it will create ~\~/.terminfo/x/xterm-kitty~ on the remote host.

#+begin_src bash
$ kitty +kitten ssh you@remote.server
#+end_src

Alternatively you can try the solution suggested in the [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/470682/39149][UNIX Stackexchange]] question I asked which manually copies the
information over.

#+begin_src bash
$ ssh myserver mkdir -p  ~/.terminfo/${TERM:0:1}
$ scp /usr/share/terminfo/${TERM:0:1}/$TERM myserver:~/.terminfo/${TERM:0:1}/
#+end_src
