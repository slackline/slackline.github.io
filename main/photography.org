I've been a long time [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline][Flickr]] user and have stuck with it despite the change of hands and increasing costs.

*** API

Details of Flickr API are at [[https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/][Flickr Services]]

** [[https://unsplash.com/][Unsplash]]

Not so much a hosting service /per se/ but a place where you can give away your pictures for others to use. Not really
investigated much but presumably you can access your own photos after uploading them!
