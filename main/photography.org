* Software

** Darktable

** Hugin

* Hosting

** Flickr

I've been a long time [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline][Flickr]] user and have stuck with it despite the change of hands and increasing costs.

*** API

Details of Flickr API are at [[https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/][Flickr Services]].

*** Flickr.org

There is also [[https://www.flickr.org/about-us/][Flickr Foundation]] which aims to preserve and make available the corpus of photos to future generations
which seems like a great idea as in the future when I'm dead I won't care if people use my photos.

Not so much a hosting service /per se/ but a place where you can give away your pictures for others to use. Not really
investigated much but presumably you can access your own photos after uploading them!
