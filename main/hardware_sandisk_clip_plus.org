* Rockbox

[[https://www.rockbox.org/][Rockbox]] is an alternative firmware for the SanDisk Clip+ and many other mp3 players.

** Installation

Instructions for installing the /Rockbox Utility/ on [[id:44b32b4e-1bef-49eb-b53c-86d9129cb29a][Gentoo]] and [[id:a53fa3c5-f091-4715-a1a4-a94071407abf][Arch Linux]].

#+begin_src sh
# Install on Gentoo
emerge -av rbutil
# Install on Arch
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/rbutil-git.git
cd rbutil-git
makepkg -sri
#+end_src

Once installed this provides the ~/usr/bin/RockboxUtility~ which can be used to manager your device.

*NB* - You need to use a decent USB cable for the device to be detected by your system.

** TTS Voice

To get this working I installed [[https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng][espeak-ng]] and selected it as the TTS voice driver when upgrading to Rockbox 4.0.
