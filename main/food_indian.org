** Green Masala Paste
*** Ingredients
+ 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
+ 6 garlic cloves chopped
+ 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh ginger
+ 40g fresh mint leaves
+ 40g fresh coriander leaves
+ 3 teaspoons of salt

*** Recipe
1. Soak the fenugreek seeds overnight, strain before using.
2. Blend/mulch all ingredients, bar oil, to make a puree. Leave to stand for at least 10 minutes.
3. Heat the oil in a karahi or wok, add the paste.
4. Stir-fry continually to prevent it from sticking until the water has evaporated (should be ~5 minutes). As the liquid
   reduces the paste will make a bubbling noise (chup-chup-chup) if not stirred and will splatter, this is an indication
   that it is done.
5. Bottle in sterilised jars, capping with hot oil.
6. Seal and store.
