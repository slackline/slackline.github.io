I bit the bullet, sold my soul and entered the world of Digital Rights Management by buying a second hand Kobo eReader
(a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_Aura][Kobo Aura]]). Its old but unlike newer models supports an external microSD card so it can have its storage capacity
expanded.

* Updating

On receipt I followed the instructions [[https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019690433-Products-no-longer-manufactured-or-supported-by-Kobo][here]] to update using the Desktop App under Mac OSX (as there is no GNU/Linux
version).
