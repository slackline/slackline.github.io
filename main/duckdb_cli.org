* Running SQL queries

Typically you will write your SQL queries in plain-text files (using [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]] of course which has excellent support for SQL
syntax). Once you have your query you will want to run it and there are a couple of ways to run code from a file I found
in this [[https://duckdbsnippets.com/snippets/198/run-sql-file-in-duckdb-cli][snippet]].

#+begin_src
# Execute the commands in my.sql then prompts for additional statements interactively
duckdb -init my.sql
# Execute the commands in my.sql then exits
duckdb -init my.sql -no-stdin
# Pipe the contents into duckdb
duckdb < my.sql
#+end_src

This is really useful for debugging your scripts, although if they are wrapped up in DuckDBR you will want to write your
query to file first to make this easier.
