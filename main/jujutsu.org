[[https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest/][Jujutsu]] is a new [[id:668debfd-9cf7-4577-9ae8-b63fcf044bb8][Version Control System]] developed by Martin von Zweigbergk at Google, although it is not an official
Google product and is Open Source Software licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

It has its own internal/native backend but also supports using [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] in the background to undertake all tasks. As such it
can be used as a drop-in replacement for [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]].

A big difference from the familiar Git model is that the working copy is automatically committed. If you check out a
commit this introduces a new working-copy commit where changes are recorded (no more ~detached HEAD~ state!).
