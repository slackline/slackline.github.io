#+TITLE: Linux Networking
#+FILETAGS: :linux:networking:

Networking is essential to modern computing and GNU/Linux servers sit behind the backbone of a significant majority of
the internet. But its complicated, not that many people understand quite how complicated it is, but then they shouldn't
have to.

This page details some of the issues I've encountered and in most cases solved.

* Examples

** Forticlient VPN at University of Sheffield

Install the following...

#+begin_src bash
  cd ~/aur && cd ~/aur
  git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/networkmanager-fortisslvpn-git.git
  cd networkmanager-fortisslvpn
  makepkg -sri
  sudo pacman -Syu openfortivpn  # If not pulled in by the above
#+end_src

Set a temporary shell variable for your username and use ~nmcli~ to define a new configuration using the following...

#+begin_src bash
  REMOTEUSERNAME=ab1cde
  sudo nmcli connection add \
       connection.id tuos-ssl-vpn \
       connection.type vpn \
       connection.autoconnect false \
       connection.permissions "user:$USER" \
       vpn.service-type org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.fortisslvpn \
       +vpn.data gateway=remoteaccess.shef.ac.uk \
       +vpn.data otp-flags=0 \
       +vpn.data password-flags=2 \
       +vpn.data trusted-cert=81581724477d04096c8407119adf7d18d48e4ff6fcecf02b6aa8ce20ae88ae25 \
       +vpn.data user="$REMOTEUSERNAME" \
       ipv4.dns "143.167.185.64 143.167.185.65" \
       ipv4.dns-search "shef.ac.uk" \
       ipv4.ignore-auto-dns true \
       ipv4.method auto \
       ipv4.never-default true \
       ipv6.never-default true \
       ipv6.method disabled
#+end_src

When you activate the connection either via the NetworkManager applet/GUI/CLI (~nmcli conn up tuos-ssl-vpn~) you will be
prompted for the password associated with your ~$REMOTEUSERNAME~ and once entered will receive a Duo Push notification
to sign in. My gratitude to my colleague Will Furnass for this solution.
