Over time the number of repositories you have and use regularly will likely grow. A useful tool for managing these is
[[https://myrepos.branchable.com/][myrepos]] which helps manage multiple repositories (the command it provisions is ~mr~ for **m**y **r**epos).

In a `git` version controlled directory run ~mr register~ which sets up ~\~/.mrconfig~ you can then update them all (in
parallel!) with ~mr -j6 update~. Commands run on individual repositories can be customised.

General configuration looks like

#+begin_src conf
[DEFAULT]
jobs = 4

fetch = git fetch --all --tags --prune
pull = git pull
push =  git push
#+end_src
