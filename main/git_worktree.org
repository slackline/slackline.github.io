Worktrees are a [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] feature that provide a method of working on multiple branches simultaneously and avoid the need to
use ~git stash~ before switching.

* Clone a bare repository

If you don't explicitly include a ~repository_name~ when cloning with the ~--bare~ option then the resulting directory
to which the clone is made carries the ~.git~ suffix. There isn't much in this repository, its pretty much the contents
of the ~.git~ directory with the configuration, ~objects~ and so forth.

With [[id:220d7ba9-d30e-4149-a25b-03796e098b0d][Magit]] you can do this with ~magit-clone-bare~

#+begin_src sh
  git clone --bare <repository_url> <repository_name>
  cd <repository_name>
  ls -lha

* Create the ~main~ worktree

First thing is to create a worktree for the ~main~ branch, once created you will see there is now a ~main~ directory
present...

#+begin_src sh
  git worktree add main
  ls -lha
   l

* Create a new worktree on a new branch

A new worktree with a new branch is created by including the ~-b <branch_name>~ option. Here I call the wortree the same
name as the branch. Once you've made changes to your branch and are ready to push them you will want to set the upstream
branch using the ~--set-upstream~

#+begin_src sh
  git worktree add -b 208-new-feature 208-new-feature
  cd 208-new-feature
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Updated the README with contact details"
  git push --set-upstream origin 208-new-feature
#+end_src

* Create a Worktree based on remote branches

Sometimes you will want to add a worktree based on a remote branch if for example there is a pull request that you have
been asked to review. You must first ~git fetch origin <remote-branch>:<local-branch>~ to get a ~fetch~ a copy of that
remote branch. Only then can you make a ~worktree~ based on it.

#+begin_src sh
  git fetch origin <remote-branch>:<local-branch>
  git worktree add <worktree-name> <local-branch>
#+end_src
