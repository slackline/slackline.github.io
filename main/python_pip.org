* Usage

Usage is fairly straight-forward, by default ~pip~ uses the main [[https://pypi.org][Python Package Index (PyPI)]].

#+begin_src sh
  pip install <pkgname
#+end_src

** Installing from other Repositories

** Installing from Cloned Source

Some projects haven't made it to a PyPI and are provided as source code on a forge such as [[id:52b4db29-ba21-4a8a-9b83-6e9a8dc02f41][GitHub]], [[id:7cbd61f2-d6a5-4e67-af72-2a13a5e86faa][GitLab]]. These can be
cloned to your computer and installed.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone git@github.com:<pkg>
  cd <pkg>
  pip install .
#+end_src

** Installing from GitHub

You can also install packages directly from GitHub
