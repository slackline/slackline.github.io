#+TITLE: GitHub Issue Templates
#+FILETAGS: :github:templates:issues:

You can create issue templates (Markdown) or issue forms (YAML) by adding the relevant files to the
~.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE~ directory of your project.

* Issue Templates

These are Markdown files that populate the issue box with details and users have to edit/change relevant sections.

* Issue Forms

These are YAML files that when selected generate a form that users reporting an issue have to complete. It is possible
to make some fields mandatory and leave others as optional.
