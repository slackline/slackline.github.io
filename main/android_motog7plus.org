* Upgrade

The [[https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/lake/upgrade/][LineageOS Wiki]] has excellent instructions on upgrading. As noted it appears to hang at 47%, just be patient and let
it finish in its own time and remember to flash ~MindTheGapps~. After an upgrade you lose ~root~ so have to go through
[[https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html][installing Magisk]] again.
