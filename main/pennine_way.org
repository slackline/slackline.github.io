Planning on hiking the [[https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/pennine-way/][Pennine Way]] from <2024-08-14 Wed> to <2024-08-31 Sat> from Kirk Yetholm to Edale

* Itinerary
** Day 1 Sheffield to Kirk Yetholm

+ Train ticket booked leaving Sheffield 08:22 arriving Berwick-upon-Tweed 11:20.
+ Bus from [[https://passenger-line-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bordersbuses/BORD/67-timetable-20220627-d2f17f76.pdf][Berwick-upon-Tweed to Kelso (67)]] Â£10.70 leaves Berwick at 14:05 arrives 15:08
+ [[https://www.travelinescotland.com/lts/#/timetables?timetableId=BODO081&direction=OUTBOUND&queryDate=1723646684000&queryTime=1718289884751][Kelso to Kirk Yetholm (81)]]
+ On reflection probably better off getting a taxi to Kirk Yelthom straight away, have lunch in the pub and then walking
  the first 12-13km to Auchope Rigg Cabin at about 12-13km (~3hrs) which breaks up the first leg nicely.
