#+TITLE: Mermaid Diagrams
#+FILETAGS: :javascript:mermaid:diagrams:

[[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/][Mermaid]] is a JavaScript library for producing diagrams. It plays well with [[id:0c371287-128d-4e46-8128-b2d4f5fc604c][Markdown]]. A really useful way of developing
your diagram is to use the [[https://mermaid.live/][Mermaid Live Editor]] to create you graph and then copy and paste the code to where you need to
use it.

* Example

#+CAPTION: Mermaid diagrams in Markdown
#+NAME: markdown-mermaid
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown :eval no

  ```{mermaid}
  graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[(Choice)];
    B -- Yes --> C([Good Choice]);
    B -- No --> D((Bad Choice));
    B -- Skip --> E[No Difference];
    C --> |Let's See| E[No Difference];
    D --> |Let's See| E[No Difference];
  ```
#+END_SRC

A very useful page to help you develop your diagrams is [[https://mermaid.live/edit][Mermaid Live Editor]] just copy and paste your code in and it will
render it.

* Git Graphs

You can generate [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] Graphs using Mermaid too. Here is one example I knocked up.

#+CAPTION: Mermaid Git Graph
#+NAME: mermaid-git-graph

%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': true}
         }
