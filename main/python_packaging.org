#+TITLE: Python Packaging

There are several options for packaging your code in Python, this document focuses on [[https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html][Setuptools]].

* Package Structure

You should place your code within a Git version controlled directory for your project. It is then normal to place all
files in an organised hierarchy with a sub-directory of the same name for Python code, tests under ~tests~

#+BEGIN_SRC bash eval: no
  .
  ├── ./build
  ├── ./dist
  ├── ./
  ├── ./tcx2gpx
  └── ./tests
      ├── ./tests/resources
      └── ./tests/tcx2gpx
#+END_SRC

* Setup

Traditionally configuration of meta-data such as author, code repository and license was made via ~setup.py~ but under
the current version of Setuptools that is obsolete. Instead it is essential to have a ~pyproject.toml~ file in the top
level of your directory with a bare minimum of...

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
  [build-system]
  requires = ["setuptools"]
  build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
#+END_SRC

You can then continue to use this file for additional configuration options or use ~setup.cfg~ or ~setup.py~ (although
the later is discouraged).
