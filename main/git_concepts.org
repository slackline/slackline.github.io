A repository is placed under version control when you ~git init~ within in but before doing so you need to set some
variables such as the ~user~ and ~email~. These can be done on a global scale which will apply across all repositories
you create or a local, per-repository basis (local settings in a repository over-ride global so they don't conflict).
