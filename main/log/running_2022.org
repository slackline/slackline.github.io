| [2022-11-23 Wed 21:50] | Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Rowlestone Woods, Blackstock Road, Bankwood Close, Cat Lane Woods                             | 6.94km   | 37min + 53s  | 5 min / km + 27.521614 s / km  | Terrible run, hate going out in the evening and dark. Tight chest, start of cold/respiratory infection (Isla has been off school ill). Right thigh bearable, just but went slowly, worse going downhill. |

| [2022-11-13 Sun 09:45] | Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Herdings Park, Water Tower, Graves Park, Derbyshire Lane                                      | 11.66km  | 63min + 59s  | 5 min / km + 29.245283 s / km  | Went very carefully, particularly on downhills, due to dodgy right thigh, didn't feel great and whilst I focused on landing on balls of feet and engaging thigh my right calf and glute ended up aching a fair bit. GOing to have to be careful. |
| [2022-11-08 Tue 14:01] | Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Rowlestone Woods, Cat Lane Woods                                                              | 8.4km    | 43min + 48s  | 5 min / km + 12.857143 s / km  | GPS tracking failed on phone so an estimate. Wary of running too far/hard as right thigh feels dodgy, took it relatively easy as a consequence. |

Slight wheeze on chest. |
| [2022-11-01 Tue 14:05] | Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Rowlestone Woods, Cat Lane Woods                                                              | 7.08km   | 35min + 30s  | 5 min / km + 0.84745763 s / km | Not too bad, felt I could push a bit and dull ache in right thigh not there, pleased with time, might try harder next time!           |

Didn't do wider loop in Graves though. |

Both legs tendons on inner thigh at hip quite sore and pretty much walked from Hope Cross to Win Hill, made some effort to jog down to station but not at all fast. Back left around kidney area was tender/tight. Stretched on finishing will do more tonight. |
