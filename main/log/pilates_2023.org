| [2023-03-28 Tue 19:49] | Enjoyed it again, some harder side exercises balancing on the hips and some for the back lying on the front.                                | Lie on front, arms under chin, clench cushion (or soft ball), tilt/roll pelvis back so tail bone goes towards ground, engaging lower back, gently lift shoulders up, raising sternum to point out, but keep back straight (don't got too high), hold then raise arms off ground to salute. |
