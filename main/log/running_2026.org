| [2026-01-05 Mon 08:36] | Carrfield Avenue, Meersbrook Road, Heeley Green, Cat Lane Woods, Blackstock Road, Bankwood Road, Cat Lane Woods, Northcote Avenue                                        | 6.66km   | 36min + 41s |      | Did not want to go out today, late to sleep (~23:30) and had been on big hike previous day so was tired, forced myself out in the freezing cold but enjoyed it in the end.                  |
| [2026-01-04 Sun 08:14] | Carrfield Avenue, Meersbrook Road, Albert Road, Saxon Road, Broadfield Road, Little London Road, Climbing Works, Little London Road, Meersbrook Park Road, Rushdale Road | 6.56km   | 35min + 14s |      | Cold and early run due to going out hiking, felt ok, right leg and knee not too bad. NEW TRAINERS! Fairly comfy, should be ok, notice right foot landing differently, cause or consequence? |

Kept moving to stay warm, felt good, less niggle in right leg/knee. Pushed hard up last hill and went fast!                                                                      |
