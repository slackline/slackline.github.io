Have to take it easy.                                                             |

Left knee very sore walking to shops afterwards with Isla 😕                |

Right side ok, hip better than knee where there is some background pain.                                                      |

NEW TRAINERS! Fairly comfy, should be ok, notice right foot landing differently, cause or consequence? |

Kept moving to stay warm, felt good, less niggle in right leg/knee. Pushed hard up last hill and went fast!                                                                      |
