| [2026-01-06 Tue 20:03] | Great session, had to work hard, lots of core and opening hips too. | Warm up by stirring hips, crossed arms role down and take a deep breath, swap over and repeat. Stretch arm over top and (unusually), twist raised shoulder (and torso) towards ground.                                                                |
|                        | (stupidly went to the wrong class, was booked in for 19:15 🤦)     | Stretch neck by tilting head to one side then looking into armpit and finally over shoulder (lifting chin and looking up and back). Hold each for at least 5 seconds.                                                                                 |
|                        |                                                                     | Ring with arms out in front, elbows horizontal with shoulders, squeeze, hold and release but then pull for same. Repeat above head as halo (don't flare chest too much) and then behind back keeping arms straight), near impossible with steel ring! |
|                        |                                                                     | Sit with both feet in ring and roll back onto sitting bones, then extend into teaser, repeat x5. Then extend and twist to one side.                                                                                                                   |
|                        |                                                                     | Did some more side twist stuff but I don't really remember the details.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                        |                                                                     | Leg extensions on back, ring in foot, pull toes back and really try to straighten the leg x10, then across body the out to side. Repeat on both sides.                                                                                                |
|                        |                                                                     | Core work involved...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Push down on lower extended leg and keep it engaged on the floor.                                                                                                          |

|                        |                                                                     | Back extensions with diamond hands to start (heels in pilates stance) and saluting each hand once then both, finally do a set of "hammer head", double salute then torso turns to each side.                                                          |
