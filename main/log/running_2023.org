| [2023-12-28 Thu 09:10] | Meersbrook Road, Norton Lees Lane, Woodseats, Abbey Lane, Millhouses Park, Little London Road, Valley Road                                | 9.34km   | 48min + 47s | 5 min / km + 13.383298 s / km | Felt good, managed several <5 min km. Took a break in Millhouses to do some upper-body exercises. Focused on good foot placement but not exaggerating ball of foot and actively lifting legs/thighs when moving legs, seems to help.                                                                                                                                                     |

Right leg still feels week like its being thrown forward and not powering forward, weak glute perhaps?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Love running in snow, about 2" fallen overnight, took it steady, no need to take rests, just steep and slightly slippery in places. Really nice run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Didn't push too hard, didn't exaggerate running on balls of feet, felt really good at end and glad I went out.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Will stretch this evening and tomorrow morning as well as fascia release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Felt good afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

No real pain or niggles whilst running.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Focused not just on landing ball first but cycling right leg more as I noticed I tend to drag/swing it forward compared to left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Right knee/hip felt ok-ish but I think my right knee is weak causing instability, something to work on.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Legs weren't hurting before and felt good throughout, no niggles. Probably been doing too much and needed a rest. Have to take more structured approach, more shorter runs perhaps. Delighted with pace (although had decent downhill section at start and little uphill but maintained pace throughout). |
