| <2024-01-16 Tue 20:56> | Nice session again, some new exercises. Hips have been better after more focus on walking and not such exaggerated running                  | With weights, elbows by torso, bring one arm back and rotate with it bringing opposite arm across body. Keep hips facing forward (IMPORTANT), switch sides. Repeat and increases pace. After repeat but with one leg raised and rotate towards it, important not to twist hips.            |

|                         | I need to tuck my chest in when standing in neutral position, seems to be because I push my shoulder blades back rather than                | Lie on front, hands under chin, lift one leg.

| [2023-03-28 Tue 19:49] | Enjoyed it again, some harder side exercises balancing on the hips and some for the back lying on the front.                                | Lie on front, arms under chin, clench cushion (or soft ball), tilt/roll pelvis back so tail bone goes towards ground, engaging lower back, gently lift shoulders up, raising sternum to point out, but keep back straight (don't got too high), hold then raise arms off ground to salute. |
