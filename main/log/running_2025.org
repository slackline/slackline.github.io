| [2025-01-21 Tue 14:39] | Carrfield Avenue, Meersbrook Road, Cat Lane Woods, long drag up to Water Tower, including  loops to side half-way and at top then back down and home. | 7.10km   | 41min + 20s | 5 min / km + 49.295775 s / km | Slow! Its a hard slog up that hill, coughing a bit more too which isn't great.                                                                                                                      |

| [2025-01-08 Wed 12:53] | Usual route but without some of the small side loops.                                                                                                 | 7.75km   | 47min + 47s | 6 min / km + 9.9354839 s / km | Very cold, lots of snow and ice meant lots of small steps and taking it easy. Enjoyed it but felt hard work, coughing a bit  earlier in the day and have something on my chest.                     |
