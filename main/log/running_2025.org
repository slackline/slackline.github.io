| [2025-04-15 Tue 13:48] | Usual circuit with extra uphill in Cat Lane Woods | 10.03km | 54min + 03s | | Focused on form but felt slow, but I think that isn't necessarily the case and times are slowly coming down. |
| [2025-04-12 Sat 09:50] | Usha Gap campsute, Thwaite and a loooong slog up Great Shunner Fell and back. Stupidly didn't restart timer from trig point until almost at the summit so doubled back to get GPS trace, adding 1.68km but not to GPX | 15.80km  | 103min + 52s |      | Painfully slow up the steep uphill sections, resorted to walking and was probably slower than when I hiked it perviously on Pennine Way (not really!). |
| [2025-04-08 Tue 20:54] | Carrfield Avenue, Meersbrook Road, Cat Lane Woods, Water Tower and back | 8.45km | 45min + 00s | | Again tried to focus on landing on ball of foot which was easy going up hill, harder down, but felt good. After the other day not a huge amount of stiff thighs (calves more so but not surprising!). Will keep it up. |
| [2025-04-06 Sun 20:44] | Carrfield Avenue, Meersbrook Road, Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Herdings Park, Graves Park, Woodseats, Fraser Road, Archer Road, Little London Road, Broadfield Road, Albert Road, Rushdale Road | 17.16km  | 95min + 39s | 5 min / km + 34.440559 s / km | Uphills were tough but generally a good run, been reading /Born to Run/ and tried really hard to run on balls of foot throughout, focus slipped towards end as I tired but pulled it back.                                                  |

Hard work on the hills, legs feel tired, need to do some weight work to build strength.                                                                                                                                         |

Pushed on and ok pace overall though.                                                                                                                                               |

Good form and breathing throughout.                                                                                |
