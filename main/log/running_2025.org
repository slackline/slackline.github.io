| [2025-01-08 Wed 12:53] | Usual route but without some of the small side loops.                                                                                           | 7.75km   | 47min + 47s | 6 min / km + 9.9354839 s / km | Very cold, lots of snow and ice meant lots of small steps and taking it easy. Enjoyed it but felt hard work, coughing a bit  earlier in the day and have something on my chest. |

| [2025-01-18 Sat 10:12] | Carrfield Avenue, Meersbrook Road, Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Herdings Park, Hemwsworth Road, Derbyshire Lane, Norton Lees Lane | 13.01km | 72min + 57s | | Long run to make up the weekly target. Generally felt good, phlegm on chest but kept an ok pace, deliberately slow on the uphill. Right glute a bit funny on last few km downhill but made up time. |
| [2025-01-14 Tue 20:24] | Carfield Avenue, Meersbrook Road, Green Hill, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Rollestone Woods, Cat Lane Woods | 8.56km | 47min + 53s | | Felt good, less chesty and less coughing. Focused on breathing didn't worry about speed/pace. Enjoyed it, possible slight niggle in right glute towards end but not as bad as previous runs. |
