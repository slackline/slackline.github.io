| [2022-11-23 Wed 21:50] | Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Rowlestone Woods, Blackstock Road, Bankwood Close, Cat Lane Woods                             | 6.94km   | 37min + 53s  | 5 min / km + 27.521614 s / km  | Terrible run, hate going out in the evening and dark.

| [2022-11-13 Sun 09:45] | Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Herdings Park, Water Tower, Graves Park, Derbyshire Lane                                      | 11.66km  | 63min + 59s  | 5 min / km + 29.245283 s / km  | Went very carefully, particularly on downhills, due to dodgy right thigh, didn't feel great and whilst I focused on landing on balls of feet and engaging thigh my right calf and glute ended up aching a fair bit. GOing to have to be careful. |
| [2022-11-08 Tue 14:01] | Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Rowlestone Woods, Cat Lane Woods                                                              | 8.4km    | 43min + 48s  | 5 min / km + 12.857143 s / km  | GPS tracking failed on phone so an estimate.

Slight wheeze on chest. |
| [2022-11-01 Tue 14:05] | Heeley Green, Gleadless, Leighton Road, Rowlestone Woods, Cat Lane Woods                                                              | 7.08km   | 35min + 30s  | 5 min / km + 0.84745763 s / km | Not too bad, felt I could push a bit and dull ache in right thigh not there, pleased with time, might try harder next time!           |

Not trying hard hence slow time.   |

Didn't do wider loop in Graves though. |
