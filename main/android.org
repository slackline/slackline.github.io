Android is a mobile operating system but its under-pinned by the [[id:0e6300c6-7025-4f45-820d-4d9da82b41a6][Linux]] kernel and uses a lot of [[id:88fc1e91-d928-485e-83b4-1991663fa267][GNU]] tools in the
background. By installing a custom ROM you can free yourself from a number of pernicious tracking practices and keep
phones that are no longer supported by manufacturers up-to-date.

* Applications

Of course there are tons of applications (programmes) one might want to install on their phone and I use a number for
convenience.

* Devices

Over the years I've owned a number of Android devices and my partner has too (these are mentioned as I often inherit
them, and root them and flash an alternative OS, typically LineageOS).

+ Samsung S2 GTi9100
+ Samsung S4 GT-9505
+ Samsung S7 Edge SM-G935F
+ Google Nexus 7

+ Motorolla G7 Power
+ [[id:349c1607-ca60-4ea2-bb53-4eb45a0e9189][Motorola G100 XT2125-4]]

* ADB

Stuff about using adb.

* Push Notifications

An alternative system to the default is [[https://unifiedpush.org/][UnifiedPush]] and the [[https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android][ntfy]] app.

* Old Phones

Old phones still have value, they are inexpensive and cheap (you already own them).
