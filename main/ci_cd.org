* Pipelight

  [[https://pipelight.dev/][Pipelight]] is a CI/CD system written in [[id:3469c33e-7c61-46c7-b01e-655695f3b93c][Rust]] that (supposedly!) simplifies the process of configuring your CI/CD
pipelines that allows you to write you pipelines in [[id:80ebb47c-7c3e-4aa4-93c4-bb15f0ee7a01][TOML]], [[id:fac7a695-9bdf-4a79-9ec3-9945e9a0cba4][YAML]] or HCL. It handles hooks and keeps track of logging for
you.
