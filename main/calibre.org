[[https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] is an excellent [[id:f277da12-5d6d-46e3-a49c-7bda9254d469][FOSS]] software package for managing ePub/PDF and other book formats. Primarily it is a GUI that
runs on your desktop but there is also a server that can be run that gives a WebUI and makes accessing and moving books
to your eReader (e.g. [[id:d08d1fe6-5317-4f09-95f7-d47e8811e007][Kobo]]) very simple.

* Installation

** Gentoo

#+begin_src sh
emerge -av calibre
#+end_src

** Arch

#+begin_src sh
pacman -Syu calibre
#+end_src

* Configuration

On first starting Calibre you are asked for a location to install the database to, copies of books (ePub, PDF etc.) that
you upload are saved here too. I create an initial database on my desktop server but then wanted to run it headless on a
server that is always on so zipped up the directory and transferred it.

** Server

Ultimately I wanted to set this up as a server so I could easily manage my books from anywhere. I found a nice [[https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-remotely-access-your-ebooks-library-with-calibre-server][tutorial]]
which walks you through how to do this. The decision I had to make was where to host. Install of Calibre was ~760Mb
which I didn't want adding to my limited VPS where I only have 40GB of storage. I therefore opted to install it on my
Raspberry Pi.


I encountered a problem setting up Calibre on the Raspberry Pi though, it requires Python 3.10 but the current version
of Python on ARM under Arch Linux is 3.12.7.
