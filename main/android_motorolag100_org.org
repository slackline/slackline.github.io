* Updating

1. Download the image via the updater as per the instructions on LineageOS
2. Whilst waiting download the corresponding ~boot.img~ to your phone from the LineageOS download page.
3. Once installed reboot.
4. Start Magisk and follow the instructions to the letter to patch the ~boot.img~, copy back to your computer and flash
   using ~fastboot~. **NB** Rebooting into ~fastbootd~ mode is _not_ what is required, rather it is the ~bootloader~
   mode which can be reached via ~Volume Down~ + ~Power~  when the phone is switched off or via ~adb -d reboot
   bootloader~. Once in ~bootloader~ mode flash with ~fastboot flash boot ./magisk_patched-<something>.img~

** ~root~

Magisk is the /de facto/ goto for rooting your device, at least in my experience of +10yrs of rooting Android devices,
its fantastic and "Just Works (TM)". Don't fuck around though, follow the  [[https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html][Official Installation Instructions]] and _only_
use the official binaries. Take heed of only using the patch created for the specific device too.

*** Enable Systemless Hosts

This allows AdAway to work.

*** Hiding ~root~

Banking apps and others don't like you having a rooted device, but you can play cat and mouse and get around
it. /Settings > |Configure DenyList/  and check the apps you want to hide. Then /Hide the Magisk app/, you get the to
rename it, I reverse the name to ~Ksigam~. You don't even need to reboot (at least for the banking app I use!).

*** Modules

There are a couple of other Magisk modules I use. They used to be accessible from the app, but alas no more. Once you
have re-rooted your device with Magisk it should detect previously installed modules (at least it did when I moved from
LineageOS 21 > 22 and at the same time went from Magisk 27 > 28).

**** Motorola Stock Camera Applications

As this is a Motorola Phone I wanted to be able to use the stock camera app which enabled all the funky functions around
the macro camera. There is a module on the  [[https://xdaforums.com/t/stock-camera-app.4443113/][XDA Forums]] for this. Once installed you can start the app and it will update
itself from the Play Store, neat.

**** Play Integrity Fix

Possibly related to hiding ~root~ but I've had this installed on my phones for I don't know how long so I keep on using
it.
