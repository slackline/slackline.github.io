I love reading books and have done since a young age when I devoured Terry Prattchet's /Discworld/ novels along with
many other books. I enjoyed reading text books for school and at University and enjoy reading technical documentation
for computing these days to find out what I need to about how software works.

As a consequence I also love buying books, although these days I have found using a [[id:d08d1fe6-5317-4f09-95f7-d47e8811e007][Kobo]] considerably easier than
lugging books around.

I have a list of books I own on [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112820224-slackline][GoodReads.com]] but being Amazon owned have divested my interests and listed most of them
on [[https://bookrastinating.com/user/slackline][BookRastinating.com]].
