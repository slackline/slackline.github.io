#+TITLE: Git Cherrypick
#+FILETAGS: :git:vc:versioncontrol:magit:

Cherry picking allows you to select specific commits, or a range of commits from one branch and apply them to your
current branch.

* Individual Files

If you just want the state of a file from another branch you can the following to pull the ~file_of_interest~ onto the
current branch

#+begin_src
git checkout <commit|branch> -- file_of_interest
#+end_src

Alternatively you can use `git diff` to show the difference between ~HEAD~ and a commit.

#+begin_src
git diff HEAD^..<commit|branch> -- file_of_interest | git apply
#+end_src

Note however that if you have enabled [[https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/][difftastic]] as your default for ~git diff~ this won't work as it doesn't produce a
valid diff!
