+ REF 2028 25% will be based on /People, culture and environment/; Contribution to knowledge and udnerstanding 50%;
  Engagement and impact 25%

** Catalysing open research at the Sheffield Universities - Jenni Adams and Katie Petherbridge
** South Yorkshire Office for Data Analytics - Vania Sena
** Building support and resources around FAIR data and software - Ric Campbell
+ What is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), enhances collboration, maximises utility of the data,
  further credit for the work, increases accountability and reproducibility.
+ AIMS of FAIR work - lots on principles, less information on actionable elements or guidance, aimed to make something
  that would be bespoke to the research area, useful and could be intermittently revised.
+ Worked with researchers across Architecture, Bio-sciences, English, Geography, Mechanical Engineering, Psychology and
  ScHARR.
+ Variation across departments with level of engagement of FAIR principles. Showed there was high variation in
+ Produced the resources [[https://bit.ly/fairGuidance][Making Research FAIR]] (link this on OSCSheffield Resources page)

+ Definitely need to be in greater contact with [[mailto:P.R.Smith@shu.ac.uk][Pete Smith]] about OSC Sheffield as the champion scheme sounds like its
  the very same sort of thing getting people together and sharing knowledge, helping each other i.e. peer-to-peer.
** Questions
*** Which repository should data be directed towards?
+ Jenni said go with what is most appropriate for the research.
+ Pete - Boundary work
+ Me - Is this a case where the repositories could become federated e.g. using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub][ActivityPub]] to co-ordinate across
  repositories?
