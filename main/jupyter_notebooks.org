* JupyterLite


[[https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][JupyterLite]] allows Notebooks to be run completely in browsers without the need for a server to be started locally. It
uses the [[https://webassembly.org][WebAssembly]] framework to achieve this.

**Caveats** JupyterLite makes heavy use of caching the Notebook and Python environment in which it runs in your
browser. You should make sure you reset this each and every time you make changes to your Notebook or if you want to
install new packages.
