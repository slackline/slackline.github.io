* Git Flow

* GitHub Flow

* Patch Stack

[[https://book.git-ps.sh/tool/][Git Patch Stack]] is a different workflow (and Git extension) to feature branches which are used in both Git Flow and
GitHub Flow.

* AGit Flow

[[id:736537b3-75e0-4c24-9156-364937e0e8a2][Forgejo]] isn't yet federated, although its an aspiration, in the meantime you can avoid having to sign-up to every
Forgejo instance by using the [[https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support/][AGit Workflow]].
