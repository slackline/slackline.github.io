Emacs LISP is a [[id:ea1499ab-dab2-49b1-8479-cb5a2fbd38bc][Programming]] language specifically for using under [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]] and it has developed and evolved in tandem with
Emacs itself. The easiest way of getting started with Emacs is to use the built-in /An Introduction to Programming in
Emacs Lisp/ that is available from within Emacs using ~C-h i m Emacs Lisp Intro~
