* f-strings

Really handy you can write code within strings using f-strings ~f"Something {n}"~, they can be formatted and you can do
maths on them.

If you are debugging then you can print the name of the variable and its value with ~print(f"{foo=}")~ which saves a ton
of typing! An extension of this is to ~print(local())~ which prints all variables in the local environment but this can
get messy quickly!

* Regular Expressions

A massive can of worms but so important. You can search for matches, substitute etc.
