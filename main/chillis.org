Chillis are one of (my) lifes delights, I can not get enough of them and the hotter the better.

* Growing
Chillis are simple to grow, and seeds are readily available, just take them out of the chilli when preparing food and
leave them in a well vented area to dry.

** From Seed
Start them early in late January/early February.  Some varieties benefit from heating mats to promote germination.

** Over Wintering

Keep the plants indoors, they will invariably lose their leaves and if not kept in warm place the stems might start to
go brown. Don't over-water otherwise they will rot. In February/March get them back in as much direct sunlight as
possible and you should have a robust plant that has a head start on new seedlings as it already has its root structure
in place.
