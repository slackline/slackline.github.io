#+TITLE: Magit Cherry Pick
#+FILETAGS: :magit:git:cherrypick:

Magit allows you to perform [[id:99f96237-270e-4c2c-81c1-0503ee2725bf][~git cherrypick~]] simplifying the workflow.

The [[https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Cherry-Picking.html][manual]] covers everything but a quick and easy workflow copied from  [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10611/how-to-easily-cherry-pick-with-magit][Emacs Stack Exchange]]...

1. ~magit-status~ (~C-x g~)
2. ~l~ then ~o~ and select the branch you want to cherry pick /from/.
3. Move to the commit/line, or select the a range of commits/lines by using ~C-space~
4. ~A~ to open the Cherry Pick transient then ~A~ again to select the range.

If you have conflicts you have to resolve them, as with [[id:1f4a3e9c-900d-4f73-b2e0-ac4e8c4037e9][Rebase]]. You can then hit ~A~ again and select to continue with
~A~.
