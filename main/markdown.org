In a similar vein to [[id:169b9c5f-df34-46ab-b64f-8ee98946ee69][Orgmode]], [[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]] is a [[id:0f476b36-8eb9-48c3-afc2-f194f701abeb][markup]] language for formatting plain text. Its simple yet pretty functional
and forms the basis of several [[id:ab2f5dfb-e355-4dbb-8ca0-12845b82e38a][Literate Programming]] frameworks such as [[id:0c371287-128d-4e46-8128-b2d4f5fc604c][RMarkdown]].

** Numbered Headings

It is possible to automatically number certain headings using a bit of CSS. The following example shows how to enumerate
level 3 headings.

#+begin_src
<style>
body {
    counter-reset: h3counter;
}
h3 {
    counter-increment: h3counter;
}
h3:before {
    content: counter(h3counter) ". ";
}
</style>


# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

### Heading 4

## Heading 5
#+end_src

* Tables

#+NAME: markdown-tables
#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no
#+END_SRC

* Figures

#+NAME: markdown-figures
#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no
#+END_SRC

* Diagrams

You can include diagrams in many Markdown documents by leveraging [[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/][Javascript Mermaid]] embedded into a code block. It has
many different types of diagrams including flowcharts, class diagrams, Gantt charts, and Git graphs. It integrates with
Sphinx in either reStructured Text or Markdown mode and is really quite simple to use (although as with many things
advanced usage is more intricate). GitHub will [[https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/][include diagraims in your Markdown files with Mermaid]] too.

See the [[id:1181fb5b-ac5e-4416-8d62-34b9de1b393f][Mermaid]] node for more information.

* Linting

** Markdownlint-cli2

I like to lint my Markdown and use [[https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2][markdownlint-cli2]] to do so, typically via a [[id:c76767c4-2a49-42f8-a323-a6d6105e0bce][Pre-commit]] hook. Configuration is via
 ~.markdownlint-cli2.yaml~. The full list of [[https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/v0.32.1/README.md#rules--aliases][rules and aliases]] is worth keeping to hand.

*** Disabling Checks

You can [[https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/v0.32.1/README.md#configuration][disable]] checks globally via the configuration file but often it is more desirable to do so on a per line basis
and you can do so with the following options.

#+CAPTION: Disable/enable all rules
#+NAME: lint-disable-all
#+begin_src
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: Disable/enable all rules for the current or next line
#+NAME: lint-disable-line
#+begin_src
<!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: Disable/enable specific rules
#+NAME: lint-disable-specific
#+begin_src
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 MD005 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD001 MD005 -->
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: Disable/enable specific rules for the current or next line
#+NAME: lint-disable-line
#+begin_src
<!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD001 MD005 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD001 MD005 -->
#+end_src

** rumdl

An alternative to ~markdownlint-cli2~ is [[https://github.com/rvben/rumdl][rumdl]] which is written in [[id:3469c33e-7c61-46c7-b01e-655695f3b93c][Rust]] and also available as a [[https://github.com/rvben/rumdl#pre-commit-integration][pre-commit hook]]. It has
a nice feature which will output annotations in a format that GitHub understands so they are automatically displayed in
Pull Requests. I'm yet to use this so can't comment but will be looking into it and have a feeling it might replace my
use of ~markdownlint-cli2~.
