In a similar vein to [[id:169b9c5f-df34-46ab-b64f-8ee98946ee69][Orgmode]], [[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]] is a markup language for formatting plain text. Its simple yet pretty functional
and forms the basis of several [[id:ab2f5dfb-e355-4dbb-8ca0-12845b82e38a][Literate Programming]] frameworks such as [[id:0c371287-128d-4e46-8128-b2d4f5fc604c][RMarkdown]].

** Numbered Headings

It is possible to automatically number certain headings using a bit of CSS. The following example shows how to enumerate
level 3 headings.

#+begin_src
<style>
body {
    counter-reset: h3counter;
}
h3 {
    counter-increment: h3counter;
}
h3:before {
    content: counter(h3counter) ". ";
}
</style>


# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

### Heading 4

## Heading 5

* Diagrams

You can include diagrams in many Markdown documents by leveraging [[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/][Javascript Mermaid]] embedded into a code block. It has
many different types of diagrams including flowcharts, class diagrams, Gantt charts, and Git graphs. It integrates with
Sphinx in either reStructured Text or Markdown mode and is really quite simple to use (although as with many things
advanced usage is more intricate). GitHub will [[https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/][include diagraims in your Markdown files with Mermaid]] too.

#+CAPTION: Mermaid diagrams in Markdown
#+NAME: markdown-mermaid
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown :eval no

  ```{mermaid}
  graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[(Choice)];
    B -- Yes --> C([Good Choice]);
    B -- No --> D((Bad Choice));
    B -- Skip --> E[No Difference];
    C --> |Let's See| E[No Difference];
    D --> |Let's See| E[No Difference];
  ```
#+END_SRC

A very useful page to help you develop your diagrams is [[https://mermaid.live/edit][Mermaid Live Editor]] just copy and paste your code in and it will
render it.

** Git Graphs

You can generate Git Graphs using Mermaid too. Here is one example I knocked up.

#+CAPTION: Mermaid Git Graph
#+NAME: mermaid-git-graph
#+begin_src javascript
%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': true}
         }
}%%
    gitGraph

       commit "This branch is for fixes to v0.1"
       branch "Missing JSON files for v0.1"
       commit id: "Add missing JSON to v0.1.0 branch"
       checkout "v0.1 fixes"
       merge "Missing JSON files for v0.1"
