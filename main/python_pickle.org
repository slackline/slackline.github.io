#+TITLE: Python Pickle
#+FILETAGS: :python:pickle:

Pickles are Pythons way of serialising and saving to disk objects, whether they are dictionaries, lists, arrays, Pandas
DataFrames, Matplotlib Images or any other type of Python object (and everything in Python is an object!). These are
saved to disk and can be loaded again in the future for subsequent usage and modification.

* Saving Pickles

#+begin_src python
  import pickle as pkl
  from pathlib import Path

  import numpy as np

  dummy_array = np.random.rand(1024, 1024)

  out_dir = Path().cwd()
  outfile = out_dir / "my.pkl"
  with outfile.open(mode="wb", encoding="utf-8") as f:
      pkl.dump(dummy_array, f)
#+end_src

* Loading Pickles

#+begin_src python
  pkl_path = Path("./my.pkl")
  with pkl_path.open("rb", encoding="utf-8") as f:
      dummy_array = pkl.load(f)
#+end_src
