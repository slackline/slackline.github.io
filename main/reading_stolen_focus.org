#+TITLE: Stolen Focus
#+FILETAGS: :reading:books:society:concentration:

I read Johan Harri's [[https://stolenfocusbook.com/][Stolen Focus : Why You Can't Pay Attention - and How to Think Deeply Again]] as I too have noticed a
decline in my ability to focus for protracted periods compared to when I was studying in my undergraduate degree,
post-graduate degree and early years of work. It's a worthwhile read and I would recommend it.
