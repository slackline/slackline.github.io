Often mistakenly [[id:9f72e8bd-2dbe-4a95-9517-c0c94bc995a0][statisticians]] get pigeon-holed into being either Frequentists or Bayesian.  I'd heard about Bayesian
Statistics early in my Masters and that there was consternation and a "battle" between Frequentists and Bayesian
methodologies (or more accurately those who practised either). Ultimately the battle part was nonsense as most people
want to use the most appropriate tools for the task at hand, although there is a philosophical underpinning to the two
approaches that can influence how one views the world from a scientific approach and how data/evidence is used to assess
the world.

Unfortunately I was never taught much about Bayes beyond the basics of conditional probability and it was a way too long
before I started to rectify the situation.

There are some great resources available that can be used to teach yourself Bayesian principles and methodologies to
then apply to your own areas of research.

** Statistical Rethinking

The book [[https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/][Statistical Rethinking : A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan by Richard McElreath]] is an excellent
exposition of Bayesian statistics and causal inference with practical examples in [[id:de9a18a7-b4ef-4a9f-ac99-68f3c76488e5][R]] and [[https://mc-stan.org/][Stan]]. The author has run a
number of online courses and makes the lectures and materials freely available (see [[https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022][Statistical Rethinking course winter
2022]]). The exercises and material has been translated into a number of different packages (e.g. [[https://bookdown.org/content/4857/][~brms~ in R]]) and
languages (e.g. PyMC3, Julia and NumPyro) although some translations are more complete than others, for full details see
links on the [[https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/][books page]].

** Bayes Rules

[[https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/][Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling by Alicia Johnson, Miles Ott and Mine Dogucu]] is another
excellent book which is available on-line for free as well as in print.
