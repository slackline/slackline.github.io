[[http://brouter.de/brouter/][BRouter]] ([[https://brouter.de/brouter-web/][Web Interface]]) is a dedicated routing engine for cyclists, its a little clunky to install and get it working with [[https://osmand.net][OSMAnd+]]
but the [[http://brouter.de/brouter/offline.html][offline routing instructions]] help.

* OSMAnd

Once you've installed the [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/btools.routingapp/][BRouter Application]] start it up, you will be asked where to store data and after following a
few prompts will be presented with a world map, zoom in and select the areas you wish to have routing for. These will be
downloaded and stored in the selected location.

You then need to configure OSMAnd+, go to ~Settings > Cycling > Navigation Settings > Navigation Type~ and select
~BRouter (offline)~. That's it when you choose to find a route for cycling it should use BRouter.
