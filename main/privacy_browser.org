* Librefwolf
Using the modified [[https://librewolf.net/][Librewolf]] (based on Firefox) is a good option to minimise tracking by default. It is worth reading
their [[https://librewolf.net/docs/settings/][settings]] documentation on how to enable/disable certain features.


* Extensions

There are a wealth of browser extensions available for Firefox (and many on mobile too).

+ AdNauseum
+ ClearURLs
+ Decentraleyes
+ Facebook Container
+ Firefox Multi-Account Containers
+ Forget Me Not
+ I Don't Care About Cookies
+ Piped Redirects
+ Temporary Containers

+ uBlock Origin


** Mobile

You can disable Firefox's Facebook data collection by following the instructions [[https://fosstodon.org/@thomholwerda@exquisite.social/112795429462507951][here]].
