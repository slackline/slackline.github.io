Linksys routers run [[id:0e6300c6-7025-4f45-820d-4d9da82b41a6][Linux]] under the hood.

* WRT54g

I owned a couple of these over the years, they were (are!) brilliant, rock solid and could be flashed with [[id:0eca0cca-f5d0-4259-879b-b7f1844c3e90][OpenWrt]].

* WRT1900ACS

Current workhorse its been just as solid running [[id:0eca0cca-f5d0-4259-879b-b7f1844c3e90][OpenWrt]].
