[[https://openstreetmap.org][OpenStreetMap]] is an amazing free, open source resource.

* Bicycle Router (BRouter)
[[http://brouter.de/brouter/][BRouter]] ([[https://brouter.de/brouter-web/][Web Interface]]) is a dedicated routing engine for cyclists, its a little clunky to install and get it working with [[https://osmand.net][OSMAnd+]]
but the [[http://brouter.de/brouter/offline.html][offline routing instructions]] help. Once you've installed the [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/btools.routingapp/][BRouter Application]] start it up, you will be asked
where to store data and after following a few prompts will be presented with a world map, zoom in and select the areas
you wish to have routing for. These will be downloaded and stored in the selected location.

You then need to configure OSMAnd+, go to ~Settings > Cycling > Navigation Settings > Navigation Type~ and select
~BRouter (offline)~. That's it when you choose to find a route for cycling it should use BRouter.

* Beat The Street

Sheffield set up [[https://beatthestreet.me/sheffield][Beat The Street]] and I requested the locations of all boxes and was pointed to a [[https://production-bts-static.s3.amazonaws.com/maps/sheffield.geojson][GeoJSON]] ([[][copy]])
which I converted to [[https://kimura.no-ip.info/~arch/beatthestreet_sheffield.gpx][GPX]] using an [[][online converter]]. I trimmed it down so that it was just the [[https://kimura.no-ip.info/~arch/sheffield_beatboxes.gpx][BeatBoxes]] and loaded
it into [[https://osmand.net][OSMAnd+]]. I can now select a BeatBox to navigate to from the map by bicycle and it will use BRouter (see above)
to get me there, I can add additional boxes to visit along the route as way points.

* Visualisation

[[https://leafletjs.com/][Leaflet]] is a JavaScript library for visualising OpenStreetMap data. There are API interfaces for Python and R.

** Python
