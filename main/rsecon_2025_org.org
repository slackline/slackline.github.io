+ [[https://academic.oup.com/book/44727?login=true][Open Source Law, Policy and Practice | Oxford Academic]] (more books [[https://amandabrock.com/books/][here]])
+ https://openaccessgoverment.org/open-source-technology/129261
+ Anti-commercialisation/academic restrictions are /not/ open-source.
+ Free flow of information (source code) is why open-source has been so popular.
+ Increasingly adopted by public sector as government want to avoid vendor lock-in.
+ [[https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change][Doubling down on open, Part II]]
+ Critical that users understand what open-source is.
+ Critical infrastructure is based on open-source and increasingly is coming under greater scrutiny and critique if it
  doesn't meet certain standards.
+ RSEs should be moving towards industry standard code but need acknowledgement for the work done,
+ Do NOT need to be certified, which requires paying for a piece of pointless paper.
+ Open source should be a public good.
** <2025-09-09 Tue 10:00>
+ [[https://nuvolos.com/][Nuvolos - Powering Education and Research in Data Science]] cloud based system for reproducible and replicable analyses.
  + Keen to learn the pain points of our research.
+ 2I2C resolutely open-source stacks for analysis and research, monitoring resource usage etc.
** <2025-09-09 Tue 10:00> Hands on Reproducible Computing with GUIX
+ [[https://guix-workshop-d08bc1.gitlabpages.inria.fr/][Guix workshop]]
+ [[https://gitlab.inria.fr/rt-santenum/guix-workshop][GitLab repo]]
*** Motivation
+ Reproducibility is the ability of independent investigators to draw the same conclusions from an expieriment folowing
  the documentation shared by the original investigators.
+ Replicability s a poort substitute for reproducibility [...] reproducibility requires changes, replicability avoids
  them.
+ Deal with sources of variations in a given experiment.
+ Sources may be controlled by / induced by the observer.
+ Goal for reproducilibity.
  + Ensure control of sources of variation in an experiment.
  + Decouple experimental results from the observer
+ "More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientists experiments and more than half
  have failed to reproduce their own experiments."
+ Scientific findings are often inaccurate.
+ Non-reproducible science costs money.
+ Academic retractions are on the rise of which experimental errors account for an estimated 25%
+ Why is science difficult to reproduce.

| Reproducibility | Target      | Addressed By                     |
| Empiricial      | Collection  | Experimental protocol, open data |
| Statistical     | Analysis    | Pre-registration                 |
| Coputational    | Measurement | Documentation, FAIR principles   |

+ Challenges for computation reproducibility...
+ Availability of code, data and programs (archiving)
+ Sufficiently detailed instructions (documentation)
+ Capturing and deploying the computational environment.
+ The case for Guix : Trasparent, verifiable and long term reproducibiliity with a single command.
+ Time traps are a problem, software relying on expired resources such as certificates, software that no longer builds
  on modern hardware.
+ Retention period (currently 2 years) of substitutes increases the build time.
+ Can reproducibility issue ever be solved, need societal changes, the research community has got bigger fish to fry, AI
  shit! that enshittifiying via generative AI.
+ "_There are some things that can't be reproduced; for everything else there;s Guix"
*** Live coding
*** Going Further
+ If no ~root~ access then you can use ~guix pack~ which can be wrapped in Docker.
+ Multiple channels for Guix - ~guix-science~ / ~guix-science-nonfree~ / ~guix-hpc~ / ~guix-cran~ / ~guix-bioc~.
+ [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/][Guix Manual]] and [[https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/][Guix Cookbook]] are really useful.
+ Guix is connecting with Software Heritage to archive projects should they disappear from say GitHub.
** [2025-09-09 Tue 14:00] Sustainable Data Sharing
+ Riva is a "RSE"  from Chille, but its not called RSE there.
+ Researchers wanted to share data that they had collected over three years analyzing the generation of scientific
  knowledge 600,000 research articles.
+ researcher goals : outreach and open science
+ RSE goals : Sustainability
+ ~5.5 million rows (740Mb) too large for computer to run.
+ Split into a relational database which changed the way researchers think about their data.
+ Still too large so had to go back to researchers and rethink the goals, split outreach and open science.
+ Outreach was useful for policy makers
+ Open Science is different goals perhaps an app with the data.
+ Fondecyt
+ Collaboration networks were too large, opted to reduce granularity
+ Funding for sustainability was challenging, not possible to host on Shiny Apps free tier.
+ Opted to build a package to make it sustainable in the long term (Did this include the data?)

** [2025-09-09 Tue 16:00] Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions - Starting From Scratch
+ CI/CD automates the tedious
+ Continuous Integration (Build, Test Merge) > Continuous Delivery / Deployment (Release, deploy respectively).
+ GitHub has runners which gives clean environments with specific versions on different OS's.
+ Customisable triggers
+ Contributes to making software FAIR as is then repeatable and reusable.
+ Why GitHub Actions, over Travis, Jenkins, Bamboo, all have paywalls, require additional integrations.
+ GH Actions are uniqutious, "free" to use on small projects with generous monthly allowance, code is already there.
+ GitLab
+ Templated YAL system, resuable actions available from the marketplace to plug-and-play.
+ Starting is simple, build complexity only when needed.

** [2025-09-10 Wed 10:35] Where do RSEs come from?
+ Blogs are an example of people performing.
+ Skills gap persists, most people need sofware skills and are self-taught or peer mentored. Little RSE led mentorship.
+ RSEs lack a consistently defined body of knowledge and its autonomy, service and status are precarious, often
  perceived as "granted" by Principal Investigators. RSE is often perceived as a struggle for recognition against
  "traditional, snobbish academic cultures".
+ Practical implication is that RSEs need to proactively define and articulate their unique value proposition and
  advocate for clearer career pathways and recognition, distinguishing themselves from technical roles that make
  less-direct research contributions.
+ RSE is highly dependent on academic structures (funding, career paths) and adopts academic logics to maintain
  legitimacy Software engineering practices are often adopted incompletely and mimetically (copying visible practices)
  rather than systematically. Key SE areas like requirements management and software maintenance are consistently
  problematic or ignored.
+ Practica Implication is that RSEs must strategically navigate academic politics, emphasising the tangible benefits of
  good software practice (reproducibility, impact) in terms that resonate with traditional academic incentives
  (publications, grants). This includes championing neglected areas like robust requirements and maintenance.
+ Research doesn't mean the software specification can't be defined, the same is true of software start-ups though.
*** A Manifesto for RSE Change
Funders
+ Systematically identify software tat needs to be sustainable using a clear checklist.
+ Ensure dedicated funding for ongoing maintenance for sustainable software.
Research producing organisations
+ Establish parallel career pathways and job descriptions for software roles.
+ Incorporate software responsibility into codes of ethical practice.
RSE Leaders & educators
+ Address skills gaps in areas like requirements engineering and sofware maintenance through targeted, evidence-based
  training.
+ Formalise outreach mentoring programmes where RSEs teach software engineering skills to a broader range of
  researchers.
+ Adopt an open source by default approach for sustainable and FAIR research software, guided by maturity models such as
  OSSWatch

+ RSE is more than a technical discipline, its a social movement aiming to revolutionise how research engages with
  software.

+ [[https://zenodo.org/records/15083632][Evidencing the Impact of Research Software Engineers on Arts & Humanities Scholarship]]
+ Lots of evidence on how RSE groups contribute to university aims, less so funders, particularly in Arts and
  Humanities.
+ Make (better) outputs possible.
+ Accelerate research
+ Expand research possibilities
+ Facilitate progress
+ Cut Costs
+ RSEs and researchers help each other across disciplines.

** [2025-09-10 Wed 13:15] Lets stop pretending we are Unicorns
+ RSEs have achieved a lot and should be proud of that, annual conferences world wide national associations in eight or
  more countries, funding opportunities, recognition of importance of sofware is increasing.
+ Sounds great, but what is the problem?
*** Problems
+ Frustration that RSE isn't doing the allocated work, the code base is complicated and they aren't doing the things we
  think they should be doing.
+ I was promised an expert on X but the RSE is standard.
+ The RSE came ti implement X for me, but now they want to constantly meet to discuss it, I just want it done.
+ The RSE wants to be a co-author on my paper, they didn't have a clue about my research.
+ The software the RSE wrote for me is falling over after the project ended but the RSE does not want to come back and
  fix it,
*** RSE Pesrpective
+ I am always on two or three projects and context switching is slowing me down.
+ My team lead put on a project with a technology I have some basic knowledge and would like to know more. That's great
  but it means progress is slower (researcher is unhappy).
+ I know nothing about the research that project is about and it makes it hard to understand the software, create
  examples.
*** Manager Perspective
+ Have to shoe-horn skills into projects.
*** What can we do?
+ Be more bespoke
+ Computational researcher might need embedded RSEs and understand the research.
+ Non-computational researchers might need [r]SEs that deliver black/grey box software solutions.
+ A small RSE team might need to specialise (e.g. HPC, web dev) rather than promise to be able to do any type of RSE
  work.
+ Communicate
+ Set expectations right, be clear and onest about what they can do.
+ Have templates, example timelines and guidelines.
+ Say no when the skill and/or time is not available (being over capacity is not a good problem to have)
+ Learn from other RSE groups, there is a lot of good practice out there.
+ Be clear with applicants too, especially if they are from industry/other career paths
*** Collaborate don't compete
+ Avoid us v them language
+ Don't claim to be "better"
+ Building relationships is an important part of RSE work
+ Learn from other RSE groups
*** Mental Health in RSE
+ Break the academic stigma around saying "I don't know", research is team work.
+ Don't paint this superhuman picture of an RSEcorn
*** What do you think?
+ Do we need more embedded RSEs?
+ Are more specialised small RSE teams the way forward?
+ How can academic RSE career paths be positively interwoven?
** [2025-09-10 Wed 13:45] The Research Software Analyst role

+ FOSS is worth around $8 trillion annually and a lot of private companies rely on OSS but they aren't contributing or
  funding development.
+ RSEs are a key, critical part of the FOSS infrastructure, many popular libraries come from RSE-like work.
+ Tricky balancing act for RSEs though as the incentives are still misplaced in academic, research and corporate
  environments.
+ Python is incredibly popular and the hype would lead you to believe PSF is well funded. But spotlight is on GenAI
  where the money already is...private companies.
+ GenAI s being pushed into everything.
+ "Don't confuse raising the floor with raising the ceiling"
+ Ceiling - high value ML drive research accelerates drug candidate discovery process, reduces cost opportunities for
  untreated. Hotel booking platform improves recommendation system.
+ Floor - high adoption Local business sets up a website without requiring help from a developer. AI app ads
  summarisation capability for research papers.
+ Reports show that Gen AI is failing at the flooor.
+ Ceiling foundational Python/Conda/Jupyter/Scikit-Laern
  Middle Frameworks Pytorch JAX Hugging Face
  Floor AI Features Copilot Chat
+ High value use cases (Ceiling) are worth development and maintenance effort.
+ Maintenance translates to long-term impact and relevance
+ The development process lets you take control, RSEs identify opportunities and push boundaries
+ Development v Maintenance is another balancing act. E.g. Conda forge spends considerably more time on maintenance than
  development has 15yrs of technical debt.
+ Maintenance is all encompasing...
  - Goal and metrics
  - People
  - Infrastructure
  - Technology
  - Culture
  - Processes
+ Systematic change: we need funding and incentives that support and prioritise sustainability (high value efforts)
