#+TITLE: Data Management
#+FILETAGS: :data:management:databases:sql:sqlite3:

Most data needs managing, if you don't it ends up messy and wasting time. It therefore pays to think about what sort of
data you are going to collect and how to manage it.

* SQLite3

A simple and lightweight database.

** List Tables and Schemas

#+begin_src sqlite
  # List tables
  .tables
  # List schema of a table
  .schema <tablename>
#+end_src

** Select from a table

#+begin_src sqlite
  SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;
  SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 10;
  # distinct values from a table
  SELECT DISTINCT <columns> FROM <table>;
#+end_src

** Replace values

~REPLACE(<string>, <pattern>, <replacement>)~ is a fairly common pattern across languages and SQLite is no different. But
you typically want to apply it to elements of a given table which is where things get slightly more complicated.

#+begin_src sqlite
  UPDATE <table> SET <column> = REPLACE(<column>, <pattern>, <replacement>)

#+end_src
