Gists are like notebooks where you can store small (or long!) snippets of code. They have a revision history like full
blown [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] repositories and therefore don't have branches. [[id:52b4db29-ba21-4a8a-9b83-6e9a8dc02f41][GitHub]] Gists are common (by virtue of [[id:52b4db29-ba21-4a8a-9b83-6e9a8dc02f41][GitHub]] being popular)
but they are also available on [[id:7cbd61f2-d6a5-4e67-af72-2a13a5e86faa][GitLab]] and you can self-host OpenGist which works seamlessly with [[id:736537b3-75e0-4c24-9156-364937e0e8a2][Forgejo]] if you are
self-hosting that too (in terms of allowing login using your Forgejo credentials).
