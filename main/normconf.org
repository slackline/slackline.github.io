[[https://normconf.com/][NormConf]] arose from the desire to talk about some of the more common but less exciting aspects of software development,
 machine learning, MLOps, DevOps and [[id:ea1499ab-dab2-49b1-8479-cb5a2fbd38bc][programming]] in general. There were interesting talks covering [[id:5b5d1562-ecb4-4199-b530-e7993723e112][Python]], [[id:de9a18a7-b4ef-4a9f-ac99-68f3c76488e5][R]] and lots
 more.
