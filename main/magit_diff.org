#+TITLE: Magit Diffing
#+FILETAGS: :magit:git:diff:

Diffing is easy, just hit ~d~ and to compare with any other branch ~r~ you'll get a buffer summarising all changes and
then showing them, line-by-line and allowing you to fold the code.

* Alternate Diff tools

I like [[https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/][difftastic]] for diffing and its easy to configure with [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] but doesn't work out of the box with [[id:220d7ba9-d30e-4149-a25b-03796e098b0d][Magit]]. Fortunately
though someone with vastly more experience of [[id:708f5d99-6040-4306-a323-306d39ce45c3][Emacs Lisp]] than me has worked out how to get Magit to play with difftastic
and shared it at [[https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html][Difftastic diffing with Magit]]. I've bound these to transient keys ~D~ and ~S~ to avoid conflicts with
the default Magit commands and it works a treat. Thank you random stranger on the internet!
