** Make a directory for every file

You can use [[http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion][variable substitution]] to quickly make a directory for every file in a given location (from [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/220026/39149][here]]).

#+BEGIN_SRC bash eval:no
  cd path/to/directory
  FILE_EXT="txt"
  for x in *.txt; do
    mkdir "${x%\.txt}" && mv "$x" "${x%\.}"
  done
#+END_SRC
