#+TITLE: Emacs Debugging
#+FILETAGS: :emacs:debugging:

Debugging in Emacs is varied, you may need to debug your Emacs LISP configuration or you may wish to debug the code of
another language you are writing in.

* Debugging Emacs LISP

This is something I have to do regularly as I tinker with my configuration (it might help if I properly learned a bit more Emacs LISP).

Useful commands

+ ~M-: (executable-find "<exec>")~ - show the path to the binary specified by ~<exec>~
+ ~C-h m~ - show the modes for the current buffer.
+ ~C-h v~ - show the value for the prompted variable.
+ ~C-h f~ - show the value for the prompted function.
+ ~C-h v exec-path~ - show the path executables are searched for.

* gdb

The main debugger for most languages is the ~gdb~
