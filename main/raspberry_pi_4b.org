I have a Raspberry Pi 4b model that acts as my NAS, music streaming service and for other tinkering. I've a 5TB USB
drive attached to it for backing up my main server. It runs [[id:742ab443-39f4-4cf6-a5ca-cb486578ad94][Arch Raspberry Pi 4b]] where you will find most of the
information about it.

* Distros

You can choose between [[https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/#arm][armv7a]] or [[https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/#arm][arm64]] stage3 files to download. Installation involves copying the stage3 install to a
microSD card to boot the Pi from.
