I've used GNU/Linux variants for almost 20 years they are brilliant and an amazing example of what can be achieved using
the Free Open Source Software (FOSS) and collaborative working. I've used many variants starting with RedHat 7.3, then
trying out [[https://slackware.com][Slackware]] for a few years before jumping to [[https://www.gentoo.org][Gentoo]] and more recently using [[https://archlinux.org][Arch]] for lower powered devices and
work machines as I don't have time to tinker/maintain them in addition to my long standing Gentoo server.
