* Reproducible Environments

** Docker

** Ansible

** Devenv

** GUIX

[[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] is /GNU's advanced distro and transactional package manager/ and allows declarative system configuration which
means the configured systems are transparent and reproducible.

* Data Version Control

In the same way [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] is important for controlling source code development it is also important to control the data and
models that are used in development and deployment pipelines. This is where Data Version Control comes in.  There are a
few different options.

** DVC

[[https://dvc.org/][DVC]] (Data Version Control) is designed for tracking version control of Machine Learning Projects.


** Dolt

[[https://github.com/dolthub/dolt][Dolt]] is Git for Data and has an SQL database in the background that can be forked, cloned, branched, merged, pushed to
and pulled from just like a Git repository.
