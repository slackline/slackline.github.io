* Reproducible Environments

** Docker

** Ansible

** Devenv

** GUIX

[[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] is /GNU's advanced distro and transactional package manager/ and allows declarative system configuration which
means the configured systems are transparent and reproducible.

* Data Version Control

In the same way [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] is important for controlling source code development it is also important to control the data and

[[https://github.com/dolthub/dolt][Dolt]] is Git for Data and has an SQL database in the background that can be forked, cloned, branched, merged, pushed to
and pulled from just like a Git repository.
