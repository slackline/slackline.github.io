#+TITLE: Git Ignore
#+FILETAGS: :git:ignore:configuration:

You can ignore files across a repository by adding patterns to ~.gitignore~ in the route of the folder.

If you want to ignore files globally you can set it via the following global configuration

#+begin_src bash
git config --global core.excludesFile '~/.gitignore'
#+end_src

This would add the following to your ~/.gitconfig~

#+begin_src bash
[core]
    ...
    excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
#+end_src

On a local repository level as well as configuring ~.gitignore~ you can add patterns to the ~.git/info/exclude~ file.

Patterns that exclude editor specific changes should go in the global file as they are not relevant to the project.

* OSX

OSX adds a ~.DS_Store~ file to every directory and this should therefore be included in your global ~/.gitignore~.
