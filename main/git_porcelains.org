#+TITLE: Git Porcelains
#+FILETAGS: :git:porcelains:clients:

Git, whilst having a command line interface, can be considered the "plumbing" for getting tasks done, in a sense a
server, whilst clients are the "porcelains" that allow you to use the functions provided.

* Magit

[[id:220d7ba9-d30e-4149-a25b-03796e098b0d][Magit]] is way ahead of anything else out there, its intuitive and guides you through complex tasks with a few
keystrokes. Of course you have to use [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]] as it is an Emacs package but that isn't a bad thing.

* gitu

[[https://github.com/altsem/gitu][gitu]] is "/a TUI Git client inspired by Magit/", but why use a Terminal User Interface when you can use [[id:220d7ba9-d30e-4149-a25b-03796e098b0d][Magit]] in [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]]? 😉

* Guitar

[[https://github.com/asinglebit/guitar][guitar]] is "/A terminal based git client with topological graph rendering/", not tried it but it has nice graphs like
GitKraken.

* GitKraken

I encountered GitKraken when I started delivering a training course [[https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/][Git & Github through GitKraken Client - From Zero to
Hero!]]. I know the content covered in the course but don't use it beyond that.
