#+TITLE: OnlyKey
#+FILETAGS: :privacy:encryption:onlykey:

I splashed out on three of these from a KickStarter project, to date I'm yet to transfer my GPG keys onto them, nor
setup my family with theirs. I like the simplicity of the design/idea, but the design, software and support just isn't
as good as the [[id:1f44c0fe-5b1c-4a02-a623-18c4eebbc851][Yubikey]] I've tried.

* Command Line Utility
#+begin_src sh
mkvirtualenv onlykey
workon onlykey
pip install onlykey
#+end_src

* udev rule
As ~root~...

#+begin_src sh
cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustcrypto/trustcrypto.github.io/pages/49-onlykey.rules
udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
#+end_src

* OnlyKey App
Only available as a Debian package (for now), but it can be installed by extracting (see instructions [[https://docs.crp.to/linux.html][here]]).

#+begin_src sh
ar xf OnlyKey_5.3.3_amd64.deb
tar xf data.tar.xz
sudo cp -r opt/OnlyKey /opt/.
ln -s /opt/OnlyKey/nw ~/.local/bin/.
#+end_src

* Arch Linux


There are packages on AUR for the OnlyKey Chrome desktop app ([[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/onlykey][~onlykey~]]) and for udev rules ([[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/onlykey-udev][~onlykey~]])

* Setup

You **have** to put the key in config mode to set it up. Hold the ~1~ button for 10 seconds to do this, it will go red and flash.

** PIN/Backup Password

The first thing to do is set a PIN, this **ONLY** uses the digits ~1-6~ and /must/ be at least 8 digits long. Save this somewhere safe, if you
lose it you will have to Factory Reset the device and lose all information.

After setting the PIN you have to set a Backup Password, this **MUST** be at least 25 characters.

* OpenPGP Key

You can add an OpenPGP key to your OnlyKey, to do so you have to export your key in PEM format. This requires you to use
~gpgsm~ and (typically) some tom-foolery. I found the answer [[https://superuser.com/a/1414277][here]] useful, but still couldn't work things out and so
[[https://onlykey.discourse.group/t/opengpg-pem-key/844/3][asked for assistance]].

As advised my OpenPGP key does indeed have subkeys and so I needed to load the decryption key to slot 1 and the signing
key to slot 2 of the OnlyKey Duo.

I followed the [[https://docs.crp.to/importpgp.html#loading-keys-a][instructions]]...

1. Export the OpenPGP compatible private key from GPG

#+begin_src sh
# List your master key and subkeys, make note of your master key you will use it in the subsequent
‚ù± gpg2 --list-keys your.email@address.com
pub   ed25519 2020-11-20 [SC]
      KJAA23980KALSJD0913UAJKNETAQ9082398345RU
uid           [ultimate] Your Name <your.email@address.com>
sub   cv25519 2022-04-20 [E]
sub   ed25519 2022-04-20 [A]
sub   ed25519 2022-04-20 [S]

# List your different keys
gpg2 --with-colons --list-keys KJAA23980KALSJD0913UAJKNETAQ9082398345RU
##READACTED##
#+end_src

The "key" here is to identify the output associated with the flag ~e~ in the official documentation it appears as
~sub:-:4096:1:8E6332B693FB6D8F:1513980282::::::e::::::23:~ the critical bit being ~::::::e::::::~ as this is the key you
need.

2. [@2] Put the OnlyKey Duo into config mode by holding down button #1 for 10+ seconds.

3. The [[https://docs.crp.to/importpgp.html#loading-keys-a][advice]] is geared towards OnlyKey /not/ OnlyKey Duo and states you should...

#+begin_quote
Copy and paste the private key into the RSA Private Key box. Ensure slot 1 is selected, the same passphrase you used
with GPG is entered as passphrase, Set as decryption key is selected. If you wish to use your PGP to encrypt OnlyKey
backups select Set as backup key (Note: If you previously set a backup passphrase and set this the PGP key will be used
instead). When finished select Save to OnlyKey

#+end_quote

...under the "/Keys/" tab there is no "/RSA Private key box/", this is because newer Eliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
keys are now supported.  Instead select the Slot as ~ECC 1 (101)~ and paste your key into the ~Key:~ box.

4. [@4] Tick the box ~Decryption key (use to decrypt messages)~

5. Enter your passphrase in the field.

6. Click `Save to OnlyKey

* Factory Reset
Supposedly you hold down button 1 for 10 seconds until it goes red then button 2 for 20 seconds and it then goes blue. I
didn't get these colours but did reset it. After having reset you need to upload the firmware.
