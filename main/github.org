* GitHub Pages

* GitHub Actions


* GitHub Blog

GitHub has an active blog and many of the articles are worth reading. I keep links to those I've read and think
worthwhile below.

* GitHub Classrooms

If you are an teacher or academic you can register for [[https://education.github.com/][GitHub Education]], aside from [[https://classroom.github.com][Classrooms]] this also confers the
benefits of GitHub Teams on organisations that you are a member of/control.

+ [[https://education.github.com/globalcampus/teacher][GlobalCampus - Teacher]] - request teams for organisations from here, check status [[https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application][here]].

* Keyboard Shortcuts

Almost every page on GitHub has [[https://images.github.media/Web/GitHubInc/%7Bdee1b5bb-19a4-4a85-9a40-678ed551e40d%7D_github-insider-archive-nov-2023.html][keyboard shortcuts]] that help with navigation, learning them can (like touch-typing and
Emacs) make you more efficient.
