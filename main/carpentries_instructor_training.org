Questions
+ How do people learn?
+ Who is a typical Carpentries learner?
+ How can we help

** Carpentries Pedagogical Model
+ Teach applied computational competence.
+ Lay foundation for future learning.
+ Interactive workshops for all participants.

** Slides
*** Skill Acquisition
+ Novice - I'm not sure what questions to ask.
+ Competent Practitioner - I'm pretty confident but I still look stuff up a lot.
+ Expert - I've been doing this on a daily basis for years!

Novices are *not* "empty vessels" they have knowledge and skills from their domain and these provide hooks into learning
new material.

*** Mental Models
+ Internal representation of knowledge : *mental model*
+ models are never perfect, they are used for recognition and extrapolation.
+ Mental models change over time, gain complexity through learning.

*** Power and limitations of analogies
+ Good analogies can help learning.
+ They provide scaffolding for the knowledge based on pre-existing knowledge
+ Be careful about fostering misconceptions.

** Exercise 1

Think of an analogy for something you work with or do as a hobby that would help teach the topic. What does it teach,
how is it useful and how is it wrong.

Atomic force microscopy record on a needle
Genome assembly - cut up a book randomly several times over and find overlapping sections.
Atomic forces - boats on a lake throwing balls to each other repel, but falls down when they attract.

*** Concept Map

When a ball is put into a container with water the [Ball]  --pushes out--> [ Water]

Repeat with different size balls, large balls push out more water than smaller balls.

+ Useful as you can work out what the order of material should be

*** Formative Assessment to Identify Misconceptions

Formative Assessment
+ Feedback through assessment
+ While we teach gives immediate feedback

  + Polls during the class
  + Asking questions - works better in small groups, large groups may require polls.
  + Doing exercises

Multiple choice questions are more summative, but can be well structured if the alternatives are diagnostic and
demonstrate how a process may have failed. E.g.

What is 27 + 15

a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33

Each wrong answer shows a methodological error.

Summative Assessment

+ At the end of a lesson or class (doesn't help the learner much)

*** The Importance of Going Slowly

+ Take time for formative assessment.
+ Many facts early on are counter productive for novices as they've not linked ideas.

*** Key Points
+ Goal when teaching novices is to help them construct useful mental models.
+ Explore our own mental models via concept maps can help us prepare to convey them.
+ Constructing a useful mental model requires practice and corrective feedback.
+ Formative assessment provide practice for learners and feedback to instructor.

*** Examining Our Expertise
+ Pitfalls of teaching as an expert are that you can often assume a level of knowledge or familiarity with the content.
+ Expert awareness gap (/blind spot).

*** Language
+ Words like "just" or "obviously" are demotivating, it implies that the learner should have got things first time,
  which isn't necessarily the case, they may have mis-heard or the explanation might not have been clear.
+ Saying things are too complicated can also be demotivating.
+ People's motivations differ widely, some are enthusiastic to learn, others less so and see it as a requirement to get
  what they want to get done done.

*** Memory and Cognitive Load
+ What is cognitive load and how does it affect learning.
+ How can we design teaching material to work with rather than against memory constraints?

*** Type of Memory
+ Long term memory: essnetially unbounded, slow to access.
+ Short term memory: 7 -/+ items at a time (or less) but fast.
+ How to shift information from short term memory to long term.
+ [[https://miku.github.io/activememory/][Short term memory test]]

*** Strategies for memory management
+ Don't overload learns by only introducing a few new concepts at once.
+ Group and connect concepts in chunks
+ Consolidate concepts through practice
+ By connecting information it allows for more things in short-term memory and helps move concepts into long-term memory.

*** Strategies for Supporting Memory Consolidation
+ Formative Assessment (see above) helps move knowledge into long-term memory. Should be frequent because short-term
  memory is limited in space and time.
+ Group Work - active discussion of information also helps consolidation. Can feel uncomfortable at first, but in
  retrospect it is usually a highly rated learning experience that people enjoy.
+ Opportunities for Reflection - asking learners for feedback (see later episodes).

*** Cognitive Load
+ Attention is constrained as well, there is no such thing as multi-tasking, performance degrades and actually tasks are
  performed one after the other.
+ Learning Attention
  + Intrinsic - performance of a task.
  + Germane - connect the task.
  + Distractions - extraneous.
+ Some cognitive load is good, and the difficulty can help improve learning, but don't overdo it and avoid overload.
+ Manage Cognitive Load with guided practice, exercises with a skeleton solution, then build on this.
  + Reduces intrinsic load
  + Avoid extraneous load
+ Contrast with Minimal Guidance
  + Guided practice is better for novices.
  + Minimal guidance may foster independence of advanced learners.

*** Attention Management
Formative Assessment
+ Multiple Choice questions
+ Faded Examples
+ Parson's problems (select and sort code fragments, see [[https://codio.github.io/parsons-puzzle-ui/][generator]])
+ Labelling diagrams or flow charts.

What to Display
+ Do /not/ show the carpentries curriculum material (people will read them!)
+ Prevent split-attention effect, talk around slides
+ For participatory live coding
  + mirror learners environment
  + speak commands as you type
*** Key Points
+ Most adults only store a few items in short-term memory for a few seconds before the lose them again.
+ Things seen together are remembered together in chunks
+ Cognitive load should be managed through guided practice.
+ Formative assessment helps move things from short to long term memory.

*** Building Skills with Feedback
+ How can I get feedback from learners?
+ How can I use this feedback to improve my teaching?

*** Surveys
+ Conduct prior and post workshop surveys to get an idea of prior experience of knowledge and in turn improve your
  feedback.
+ Timing matters most likely to be completed if still at the workshop, plan for time during the last 15 minutes.
*** Minute Cards
+ Before long breaks or between days, private and anonymous feedback.
+ One positive/one constructive feedback.
+ Look for patterns/problems and use feedback to adadpt workshop.
+ Be explicit about what the feedback will be used for as it helps motivate people to give things.
+ More specific questions get better feedback.

Examples

**** Positive
+ One thing you liked.
+ Most important thing you learned today.
+ What are skill are you most excited about using.

**** Constructive
+ What was confusing
+ What questions do you have

*** One-up, One-down
+ Go round the group, one person positive, next negative, no repetition allowed.
+ Forces people to say things they may not otherwise say.
+ Collect but don't discuss feedback.
+ Instructors discuss feedback afterwards and respond the next day.

** Homework

+ Prepare an episode!
