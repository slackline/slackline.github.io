The alternative firmware for routers which came about because [[id:f2286e26-a0eb-4d99-9c86-2b002a43c310][Linksys]] were forced to open-source the firmware used on their
original WRT54Gs as they use [[id:0e6300c6-7025-4f45-820d-4d9da82b41a6][Linux]] I still own a couple of units (but don't use them).


* WRT54G

Last official [[https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g][OpenWrt]] support was 19.07.10.


* WRT1900ACS

My current workhorse which has been very stable. I'm loathe to upgrade to the current 24.10.4 as the household is so
reliant on it.

** Extensions

I use a few additional packages on this device.

* D-Link 615

Inherited an old one of these, wasn't using it so I passed it onto a friend. Made some notes about [[id:9460e401-9a76-4853-99e9-16dd4fc79819][setting it up]]
