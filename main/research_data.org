* Open Data

The FAIR principles are that data is Findable, Accessible Interoperable and Reusable. They are not rigorous in their
formulation but are rather meant to encourage researchers to think about how their data could be curated in such a
manner that it is usable by others.

A major feature therefore lies around what metadata is used to describe the data contained within. This should be rich
in detail so that the content is well described and to make it findable it should include a globally unique and
persistent identifier, that makes it possible to retrieve the data
