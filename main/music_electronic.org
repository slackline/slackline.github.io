#+TITLE: Music Electronic
#+FILETAGS: :music:electronic:

A diverse genre but broadly my favourite (perhaps that is because of the diversity!). Listened to lots in the late 90s
and early 00s. These days love discovering new and diverse music via [[https://www.radiofrance.fr/fip/radio-electro][FIP Electro]] a French radio station.
