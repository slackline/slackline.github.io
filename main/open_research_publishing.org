* Publishing

Many journals have adopted open access research policies in recent years, although many push the cost for this onto the
author, something that then has to be budgeted in the grant application.

* Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) make it easy to cite and find papers, data, software and other material. You can even
obtain a DOI for yourself via [[https://orcid.org/][ORCiD]].
