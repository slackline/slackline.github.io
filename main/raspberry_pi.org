#+TITLE: Raspberry Pi
#+FILETAGS: :linux:hardware:

I have got a number of Raspberry Pis from over the years.  Typically I run [[id:a53fa3c5-f091-4715-a1a4-a94071407abf][Arch Linux]] on them.

* Multiroom Audio

I use [[https://mjaggard.github.io/snapcast/][Snapcast]] ([[https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/][GitHub]]) on my main Pi 4b to serve up audio that is synchronised to other PiZeroW that are hooked up to
speakers around the house for a simple, cheap but effective multi-room audio experience at home. Input comes from [[https://www.musicpd.org/][Music
Player Daemon]] which I can control from my phone using [[https://gitlab.com/gateship-one/malp][M.A.L.P.]].
