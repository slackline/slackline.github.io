#+TITLE: NixOS - Flakes
#+FILETAGS: :nixos:linux:configuration:

One of my colleagues has also been experimenting with NixOS and put me onto the [[https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/introduction/][NixOS & Flakes Book]]. As it clearly
states Flakes is experimental, but has seen wide-spread adoption in the community. I therefore opted to go with the
flow, willing to accept there may be some breaking changes down the line. I don't mind this, I first installed [[id:44b32b4e-1bef-49eb-b53c-86d9129cb29a][Gentoo]]
about 20 years ago and before that ran Slackware for a few years after getting frustrated with circular dependency hell
under Red Hat Linux 7.3.

The configuration to enable this is declared, as [[https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/nixos-with-flakes-enabled#enable-nix-flakes][described]], in ~/etc/nixos/configuration.nix~...

#+begin_src
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports = [
    ./hardware-configuration.nix
  ];
  nix.settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
  environment.systemPackages = withpkgs; [
    emacs
    git
    wget
  ]
};
#+end_src

And after making any changes we need to ~nixos-rebuild switch~. This again failed so I regenerated a basic ~flake.nix~
with

#+begin_src
nix flake new example -t github:nix-community/home-manager#nixos
#+end_src

I had to modify the ~hostname~ variable in this generated file to reflect the hostname that I had set. but still got an
error when trying to ~nixos-rebuild switch~ that ended with ~system.copySystemConfiguration is not supported with
flakes~. A quick search on the forums threw up [[https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-config-error-while-combining-configuration-nix-and-flakes/23918][this thread]] which suggested disabling ~system.copySystemConfiguration =
false~ in the ~configuration.nix~ file.

* Templates

You can create templates using ~nix flake~, to get a list of available templates...

#+begin_src
nix flake show templates
#+end_src

** Troubleshooting

I found that just trying to show the templates resulted in an error.

#+begin_src
error:
       â€¦ while fetching the input 'github:NixOS/templates'

       error: opening Git repository '"/home/neil/.cache/nix/tarball-cache"': repository path '/home/neil/.cache/nix/tarball-cache' is not owned by current user
#+end_src

A crude, temporary solution was provided [[https://discourse.nixos.org/t/home-manager-and-git-repo-ownership/41567/3][here]] but this didn't feel quite right, I think the cache should point somewhere
else that the ~root~ user (or whatever user the ~nix~ command runs as) can access by default.
