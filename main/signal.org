#+BEGIN-QUOTE:
Meta owns WhatsApp and recently updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with the Meta family for advertisement
purposes.

WhatsApp is owned by Meta, a company with a reputation for commoditizing data. It doesnâ€™t even hide its intentions to
collect your WhatsApp data, as you cannot use the app if you decline to share your data with the company.
