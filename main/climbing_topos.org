I've a lot of links on my [[https://wiki.nshephard.dev/doku.php?id=climbing:climbing][old wiki]].

* Open Climbing Resources

There are at least two efforts to collate and make climbing information freely open.

** [[https://openclimbing.org][OpenClimbing.org]]

This is based on [[id:0a5f391b-0f61-48d8-a4c3-a204d55538de][OpenStreetMap]], routes have individual entries as ways
which are grouped into crags and areas.

** [[https://openbeta.io][OpenBeta.io]]

[[https://openbeta.io/][OpenBeta.io]] is an independent attempt to democratise climbing/boudlering route information.
