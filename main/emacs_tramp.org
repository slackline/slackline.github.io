[[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]] is a protocol for editing files either as another user on your own files system or on a remote file system over SSH
(providing you have permission to access the system!).

* Configuration

#+INCLUDE: "~/.config/emacs/settings/tramp-settings.el" example emacs-lisp

* General Syntax

The general syntax for opening a file is.

#+begin_src emacs_lisp
  C-x C-f /[method/user]:[@remotehost]]:/filename
#+end_src

* Editing as root

You can open a file on the same system as ~root~ using.

#+begin_src emacs_lisp
C-x C-f /su::/etc/resolv.conf
C-x C-f /sudo::/etc/resolv.conf
#+end_src

You may find you'll be asked for your GPG key if you have that configured and then the ~root~ password or user password
depending on whether you are using using ~su~ or ~sudo~

* SSH

To open files over SSH you should have access (obviously!) and ideally setup a SSH keys with keychain to ease the
process.

#+begin_src emacs_lisp
  C-x C-f /ssh:user@remote/
#+end_src
