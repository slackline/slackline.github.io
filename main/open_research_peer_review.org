* Peer Review

Just as traditional journals undertake peer review, the literate programming and code that underpins the analyses of a
piece of body of research can be peer reviewed. A pre-requisite is having access to the original data and code used to
prepare and analyse is and a first step would be to ensure that the results published can be faithfully reproduced from
the data and the code.
