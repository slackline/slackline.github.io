[[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/][R Markdown]] is a superb language for [[id:ab2f5dfb-e355-4dbb-8ca0-12845b82e38a][Literate Programming]] as it leverages the simplicity of [[id:0c371287-128d-4e46-8128-b2d4f5fc604c][Markdown]] but enriches it with
embedded code that can display tables, graphs and more as well as supporting in-line code and [[id:e1c2cfef-1b43-47a8-a425-94e6ae58d917][LaTeX]]. A lot of the notes
here overlap with [[id:251b3ae4-4a5c-4c44-909a-dcbc0aef4b45][Quarto]].

* Code Blocks

* LaTeX

* Extracting Code Chunk

If you want to extract your [[id:251b3ae4-4a5c-4c44-909a-dcbc0aef4b45][Quarto]] code chunks to their own script you should include the ~#| purl: true~ in the header
of the code cells (see [[https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html][Quarto â€“ Code Cells: Knitr]]) and you can then run ~knitr::purl()~ on the file to get the code
chunks written to a separate file, by default the name of the source file with the extension ~.R~ in the current
directory but that can be modified.

#+begin_src: R
knitr::purl(input="input.qmd", output="path/to/output.R")
#+end_src
