Sometimes you might add files that you shouldn't have to a [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] repository. Its not enough to delete (or `git rm`) them
from your repository as their presence is recorded in the [[id:3c905838-8de4-4bb6-9171-98c1332456be][Git]] history. Instead you need to remove them completely from
the history. This can be achieved using the [[https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/][Git Filter Repo]] extension.
