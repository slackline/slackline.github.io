* Installation

** Arch Linux
I found ~owntracks-recorder~ required me to manually install ~pkg-config~ first as the ~PKGBUILD~ doesn't currently list
it as a dependency.

#+begin_src
cd ~/aur
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/owntracks-{recorder,frontend}.git
cd owntracks-recorder
makepkg -sri
cd ../owntracks-frontend
makepkg -sri
#+end_src

** Gentoo

Only the recorder appears to be available in Portage for now.

#+begin_src
emerge -av owntracks-recorder
#+end_src

* Configuration

The following applies to the installation under [[id:a53fa3c5-f091-4715-a1a4-a94071407abf][Arch Linux]] as I deployed this on my VPS.

** User Configuration


** Nginx Reverse Proxy

Helpfully there is a [[https://github.com/owntracks/recorder#nginx][clear]] example of a reverse proxy. It recommend password protecting the site.
