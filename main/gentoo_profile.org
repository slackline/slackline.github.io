#+TITLE: Gentoo Profiles
#+FILETAGS: :linux:gentoo:admin:

Profiles are a default set of ~USE~ flags and ~@system~ packages that are installed. They reside in
~/var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/~ and are selected by symbolically linking ~/etc/portage/make.profile~ to the desired
profile you wish to use.

I know I don't want to run any 32-bit applications as I've no desire to use WINE nor do I game so I opted for
~default/linux/amd64/23.0/split-usr/no-multilib~.

* Selecting profiles

#+begin_example
eselect profile list
eselect profile set ##
