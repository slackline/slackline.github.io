[[id:323647af-4d22-4b24-9763-320da9a1d76d][Bisecting]] in [[https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Bisecting.html][Magit]] is started with ~B~ to set the start (i.e. the good commit), the bad is taken to be the ~HEAD~ of the
current branch. When bisecting is in progress there are transient suffixes to mark commits as "Bad" (~b~), "Good" (~g~)
"Mark" (~m~) which allows the use of terms other than "Bad" and "good", "Skip" (~k~) and when complete to "Reset" (~r~).
