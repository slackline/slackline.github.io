Linux is often considered the poster-child for the [[id:f277da12-5d6d-46e3-a49c-7bda9254d469][FOSS]] movement, but things actually started a lot earlier when [[id:0e3e2e06-d587-404e-ab7b-21837a60118a][Richard
Stallman]] setup the [[id:8b1e2298-ee48-43d3-a00b-94bb68413927][Free Software Foundation]] and started the [[https://www.gnu.org/][The GNU Operating System and the Free Software
Movement]] (of which [[id:754f25a5-3429-4504-8a17-4efea1568eba][Emacs]] is just one component, albeit a very important one!). There is the related  [[https://www.eff.org/][Electronic Frontier
Foundation]]  which also champions civil liberties in the digital world.

Linux is the code that gets your hardware to talk to each other and interact with the GNU Operating System and so is
itself, a pretty important component (the GNU attempt to get a replacement UNIX kernel, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/][hurd]] is /still/ a work in
progress).

I've used GNU/Linux variants for almost 20 years they are brilliant and an amazing example of what can be achieved using
the [[id:f277da12-5d6d-46e3-a49c-7bda9254d469][Free Open Source Software (FOSS)]] and collaborative working. I've used many variants starting with RedHat 7.3, then
trying out [[https://slackware.com][Slackware]] for a few years before jumping to [[https://www.gentoo.org][Gentoo]] and more recently using [[https://archlinux.org][Arch]] for lower powered devices and
work machines as I don't have time to tinker/maintain them in addition to my long standing Gentoo server.


* Distributions

I started with RedHat 7.3 at work setting up a server for others to run their [[id:9aa32f65-144f-4c52-aab6-afebd17c1e5b][Genetic]] analysis on. Quickly decided to
try out [[http://www.slackware.com/][Slackware]] at home, liked compiling from source and the lack of circular dependency hell that frustrated me with
RedHats RPM system.  After a while wanted a package management system as I found it awkward uninstalling a packages
dependencies and so tried out [[id:44b32b4e-1bef-49eb-b53c-86d9129cb29a][Gentoo]] and loved it and still use it to this day. For laptops and lower-powered devices
I've settled on [[id:a53fa3c5-f091-4715-a1a4-a94071407abf][Arch Linux]] as I've never bothered to set up distributed cross-compilation under Gentoo. I'm very
interested to give NixOS a whirl though.

* Shells

I was a happy [[id:9c6257dc-cbef-4291-8369-b3dc6c173cf2][Bash]] user for many years but then I started a job at a tech company and people were using the fancy [[id:a1b78518-31e8-4fd3-a36f-d8f152832138][ZSH]]
along with the [[https://ohmyz.sh/][Oh-myZsh]] framework. I liked the extra information and tools it provided so switched and haven't looked
back. I still use Bash for my ~root~ account though just to make me a little more cautious.

* Web Hosting

I use Linux on my VPS and various places to host websites. I've written more on this at [[id:e1dcf5fc-2125-455d-b800-d3f1b318c8c9][Web-hosting.]] Useful topics on
specific services are also written up at.

It can be handy to have a live distribution to carry around and boot as and when, there are a few options read more at

* Privacy

A lot of FOSS respects and protects your [[id:b5000932-0fec-4353-acc4-0cb02127c9ac][privacy]] as it is more transparent than closed source software.
