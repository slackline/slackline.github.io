I'm forever trying to convince people to try out Emacs and figured it would be worthwhile writing a short guide to
getting started [[id:36a83dd6-7535-43a9-9b68-15dc135c86fd][Emacs Getting Started]].

* Packages

Packages are what makes Emacs so great, there is literally a [[https://xkcd.com/378/][package for everything.]]

[[./img/emacs/real_programmers.png]]

There are a number of ways of repositories that host repositories (see [[id:ff8ee302-7518-4179-9bcb-63b13199f897][Emacs Packages]])

Sometimes packages need to be byte-compiled again, this can be achieved using ~M-: (byte-recompile-directory
package-user-dir nil 'force)~ which will [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/1217249][force compilation]] of existing ~.elc~ files.

* Dired

[[id:e2a2ead1-4348-4cc6-9ef1-dd96777aaec8][Dired]]

* Buffers

[[id:4451966f-b810-4a9d-905b-e2b682578c62][Buffers]] are the basis of Emacs, the window through which you view files and processes, understanding how they work and
navigating between the vastly improves your productivity.

* GPG

Emacs works easily with [[id:ce08bd82-0146-49cb-8a64-048ffe7210f2][GPG]]. As long as you have your keys available you can create a file and save it with the
extensions ~.gpg~ and Emacs will encrypt it automatically. Open the file and its decrypted. There is of course more to
it if you are sharing files and encrypting with others public keys. Read more in the [[id:d1ce8192-41ce-4073-9fe8-654fd17fdadb][Security]] pages.

A useful article on using GPG with Emacs is [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/keeping-secrets-in-emacs-gnupg-auth-sources][Keeping Secrets in Emacs with GnuPG and Auth Sources - Mastering Emacs]]

* Magit

[[id:220d7ba9-d30e-4149-a25b-03796e098b0d][Magit]] is an amazing package, its a porcelain to Git which means it gives access to all of the functions on the command
line. It is widely considered a killer feature of Emacs (along with [[id:169b9c5f-df34-46ab-b64f-8ee98946ee69][Orgmode]]). Learn to use it and you'll find your use
of and productivity using Git dramatically increases.

* Org-mode

Org-mode is a powerful suite of packages that allow you to organise your work and life. Org-mode is another killer
feature of Emacs (along with Magit).

+ [[id:fc9974d4-2a26-4bf7-9360-c828bfaeed1d][Org Agenda]]
+ [[id:6e75f9df-df3d-4402-b5ad-ed98d0834e08][Org Babel]]
+ [[id:136364e7-1a6d-4b28-b284-0e415b860699][Org-roam]]

* Programming IDE

Emacs can be used as a powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for a range of [[id:ea1499ab-dab2-49b1-8479-cb5a2fbd38bc][Programming]] languages thanks to
its support of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) courtesy of which supports [[id:5b5d1562-ecb4-4199-b530-e7993723e112][Python]], [[id:de9a18a7-b4ef-4a9f-ac99-68f3c76488e5][R]], [[id:9c6257dc-cbef-4291-8369-b3dc6c173cf2][Bash]] and many others. This is
achieved through one of two packages.

+ [[id:efe4e098-d7e6-42cd-90bd-234a25806c3a][Eglot]]

* Projects

Emacs has built in support for managing [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html][projects]] but, as is always the case, there are a number of packages which extend
or provide alternatives. Perhaps the most popular is [[id:580157bf-0313-4c4e-88d3-cd443ddbab62][Projectile]].

* TRAMP

[[id:b9961a9e-e833-4160-aa8f-1c69b9cbb397][Emacs TRAMP]] is a really useful feature that allows you to open files as other users (e.g. ~root~) on your local file
system or over [[id:b39ebc4e-3351-45e3-80b8-9780c76dbbb6][SSH]] to systems you have access to so you can edit files remotely. For more on this see [[id:b9961a9e-e833-4160-aa8f-1c69b9cbb397][Emacs TRAMP]].

* Emacs Lisp

[[id:708f5d99-6040-4306-a323-306d39ce45c3][Emacs Lisp]] is the language which gives Emacs its power and extensibility. Understanding just the basics makes
configuring and using Emacs considerably easier, going deeper you can then develop your own functions to extend existing
packages or even develop your own packages and share them with the community.

* SQLite3

Emacs 29 gained builtin support for [[id:3735f87b-346e-4c0d-a172-545e23570bcb][sqlite3]].


* Configuration

My configuration is, well, sprawling. The main initialisation file resides at ~/config/emacs/init.el~ but I split it
over a number of individual files for each package or group of packages. Unsurprisingly there are a lot of packages that
I use (yet to settle down), you can read more about configuration
[[id:938af6af-7a0e-46d1-ae76-6157e948151b][Emacs Configuration]].

** Templates

Emacs has built-in templates but they can also be provided by Yasnippets. For more see [[id:a8c134c6-bb0f-408d-96ee-48b02da8cffe][Emacs Templates]].

* Password

I use [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass the standard UNIX password manager]] and its great, better still there are various Emacs packages for working
with ~pass~. Read[[id:ac85ca6b-4b6e-4e8d-82f8-2f85c5062de6][emacs_pass]]
