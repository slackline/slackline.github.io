* Packages

Packages are what makes Emacs so great, there is literally a [[https://xkcd.com/378/][package for everything.]]

[[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png]]

There are a number of ways of repositories that host repositories (see [[#packages]])

* Magit

[[id:220d7ba9-d30e-4149-a25b-03796e098b0d][magit]]

* Org-mode

Org-mode is a powerful suite of packages that allow you to organise your work and life.

+ [[id:136364e7-1a6d-4b28-b284-0e415b860699][Org-roam]]

* Programming IDE

Emacs can be used as a powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for a range of [[id:ea1499ab-dab2-49b1-8479-cb5a2fbd38bc][Programming]] languages thanks to
its support of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) courtesy of which supports [[id:5b5d1562-ecb4-4199-b530-e7993723e112][Python]], [[id:de9a18a7-b4ef-4a9f-ac99-68f3c76488e5][R]], [[id:9c6257dc-cbef-4291-8369-b3dc6c173cf2][Bash]] and many others. This is
achieved through one of two packages.

* Emacs Lisp

[[id:708f5d99-6040-4306-a323-306d39ce45c3][Emacs Lisp]] is the language which gives Emacs its power and extensibility. Understanding just the basics makes
configuring and using Emacs considerably easier, going deeper you can then develop your own functions to extend existing
packages or even develop your own packages and share them with the community.


* Configuration

My configuration is, well, sprawling. The main initialisation file resides at ~/config/emacs/init.el~ but I split it
configuration over a number of individual files for each package or group of packages.
