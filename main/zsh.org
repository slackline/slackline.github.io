* Tips & Tricks

** Pip install optional extras

I found the hard way that ZSH uses square brackets (~[ ]~) for globbing when I was trying to install optional additional
packages using [[id:5b5d1562-ecb4-4199-b530-e7993723e112][Python]] package manager [[id:47543a76-a873-4c07-b30d-926f50b31fca][pip]] which takes the format.

#+begin_src sh :eval no
  pip install .[optional_extra]
#+end_src

To get round this you can either quote the target

#+begin_src sh :eval no
  pip install ".[optional_extra]"
#+end_src

Or put an alias in ~/.zshrc~

#+begin_src sh :eval no
  pip='pip noglob'
#+end_src

** zmv

This is a neat extension to ~mv~ that facilitates [[https://blog.smittytone.net/2021/04/03/how-to-use-zmv-z-shell-super-smart-file-renamer/][batch file renaming]].

To enable it add the following to ~.zshrc~

#+begin_src sh :eval no
  autoload zmv
#+end_src

* History

There are a few options, tools and plugins for working with history. Ensuring there are no duplicates is really useful
as is setting the maximum size of your history to a very high level so that you retain a lot of your history.

I have the following options set.

#+begin_src sh
setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY
setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY
setopt HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS
export HISTTIMEFORMAT="[%F %T]"
export HIST_STAMPS="yyyy-mm-dd"
export SAVEHIST=100000
export HISTSIZE=5000
#+end_src

** Tips and Tricks

+ Start a command with a space it /won't/ be saved in your history. Useful for sensitive commands that include passwords
  or keys.
