#+TITLE: Git Forges
#+FILETAGS: :git:forges:gitlab:github:


Forges are places where Git repositories are hosted online for collaborative work. If public then others can view, fork
(make a copy online), clone (make a local copy) and then change the code themselves and if its useful submit a Pull
Request to have their changes incorporated into the original body of code for a project. Read more about each Forge at
the linked pages.
