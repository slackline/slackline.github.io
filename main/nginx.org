#+TITLE: Nginx
#+FILETAGS: :gnu:linux:nginx:web:

* Installation

Available across packages install as appropriate to your OS.

#+begin_src bash
  emerge -av nginx        # Gentoo
  pacman -Syu nginx       # Arch
  apt-get install nginx   # Ubuntu
#+end_src


* Configuration

** Dokuwiki

I use [[id:bc096b27-5f0e-426c-9722-7798e12ca2dc][Dokuwiki]] to host a couple of wiki's as its simple and doesn't require a database.

** Wordpress

I also (used to) host a Wordpress site with the intention of monetising my photography. Never got a single sale but I
keep the domain and one day I might update the installation and get it working again.

** LetsEncrypt

I use LetsEncrypt to provide certificates for my sites so they are secure.
