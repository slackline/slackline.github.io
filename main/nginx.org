* Configuration

** General

*** Block "AI" Bots

I wanted to block AI bots on my self-hosted sites. Thanks to [[https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/][Blocking Bots with Nginx by Robb Knight]] this was pretty
straight-forward. I didn't have the same strict requirements as the author of the article so I created
~/etc/nginx/redirect.conf~  and added to it the following entry which is case-insensitive list of AI Bot names from
[[https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt/blob/main/robots.txt][here]].

#+begin_src
# List from https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt/blob/main/robots.txt
if ($http_user_agent ~* "(AI2Bot|Ai2Bot-Dolma|Amazonbot|anthropic-ai|Applebot|Applebot-Extended|Bytespider|CCBot|ChatGPT-User|Claude-Web|ClaudeBot|cohere-ai|Diffbot|DuckAssistBot|FacebookBot|facebookexternalhit|FriendlyCrawler|Google-Extended|GoogleOther|GoogleOther-Image|GoogleOther-Video|GPTBot|iaskspider/2.0|ICC-Crawler|ImagesiftBot|img2dataset|ISSCyberRiskCrawler|Kangaroo Bot|Meta-ExternalAgent|Meta-ExternalFetcher|OAI-SearchBot|omgili|omgilibot|PerplexityBot|PetalBot|Scrapy|Sidetrade indexer bot|Timpibot|VelenPublicWebCrawler|Webzio-Extended|YouBot)"){
    return 307 https://ash-speed.hetzner.com/10GB.bin;
}
#+end_src


Any bot that matches the above "user agent" will get redirected to ~https://ash-speed.hetzner.com/10GB.bin~.

For each ~server{...}~ entry under ~/etc/nginx/nginx.conf~ I then added the following line to include the above file.

#+begin_src
        include /etc/nginx/redirect.conf
#+end_src


Restart the server and test by changing the "user agent" in any browser to one that matches the above and I was asked if
I wanted to download a ~10GB.bin~ file.

*** Serve AI Bots Junk

Came across [[https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/][Nepenthes]] which infinitely generates junk pages when web-crawlers hit it. Not yet deployed this.

This isn't the only approach its possible [[https://tzovar.as/algorithmic-sabotage-ii/][Algorithmic sabotage for static sites II: Images]] too.

*** Codeberg/GitHub static stites

You can also serve up junk on static sites that are hosted on Codeberg/GitHub pages using the approach described in
[[\[\[https://tzovar.as/algorithmic-sabotage-ssg/\]\[Bastian Greshake Tzovaras · Algorithmic sabotage for static
sites\]\]][Algorithmic sabotage for static sites]]. It uses the [[https://marcusb.org/hacks/quixotic.html][Quixotic]] tool to achieve this.

** LetsEncrypt

I use LetsEncrypt to provide certificates for my sites so they are secure. Using Nginx when renewing remember to include
the ~--nginx~ flag.

#+begin_src
certbot --nginx renew
#+end_src

A useful tool for debugging why certificate issue may fail is [[https://letsdebug.net/][Let's Debug]]

In 2025 LetsEncrypt started [[https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/getting-ready-to-issue-ip-address-certificates/][issuing certificates for IP addresses]] which is really useful for those seeking to encourage
adoption of the [[https://ar.al/2025/06/25/web-numbers/][SmallWeb]].

* Servers

** [[https://wiki.nshephard.dev][Dokuwiki]]

I use [[id:bc096b27-5f0e-426c-9722-7798e12ca2dc][Dokuwiki]] to host a couple of wiki's as its simple and doesn't require a database.

** [[https://freshrss.nshephard.dev][FreshRSS]]

** [[https://opengist.nshephard.dev][OpenGist]]

This runs locally and uses a reverse proxy to connect to it from the outside world. It plays nicely with ForgeJo and
allows used of its login options.

** [[https://forgejo.nshephard.dev][Forgejo]]

** [[id:d9c960c2-71b6-45e6-b388-dcd07b9da3e1][FitTrackee]]

** [[https://owntracks.nshephard.dev][OwnTracks]]

I setup my own [[id:5315e7ee-0ed9-4514-b1a9-0a03114d8191][owntracks]] instance.

** Wordpress

I also (used to) host a Wordpress site with the intention of monetising my photography. Never got a single sale one day
I might update the installation and get it working again.
