** General

*** Block "AI" Bots

I wanted to block AI bots on my self-hosted sites. Thanks to [[https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/][Blocking Bots with Nginx by Robb Knight]] this was pretty
straight-forward. I didn't have the same strict requirements as the author of the article so I created
~/etc/nginx/redirect.conf~  and added to it the following entry which is case-insensitive list of AI Bot names from
[[https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt/blob/main/robots.txt][here]].

#+begin_src
# List from https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt/blob/main/robots.txt
if ($http_user_agent ~* "(AI2Bot|Ai2Bot-Dolma|Amazonbot|anthropic-ai|Applebot|Applebot-Extended|Bytespider|CCBot|ChatGPT-User|Claude-Web|ClaudeBot|cohere-ai|Diffbot|DuckAssistBot|FacebookBot|facebookexternalhit|FriendlyCrawler|Google-Extended|GoogleOther|GoogleOther-Image|GoogleOther-Video|GPTBot|iaskspider/2.0|ICC-Crawler|ImagesiftBot|img2dataset|ISSCyberRiskCrawler|Kangaroo Bot|Meta-ExternalAgent|Meta-ExternalFetcher|OAI-SearchBot|omgili|omgilibot|PerplexityBot|PetalBot|Scrapy|Sidetrade indexer bot|Timpibot|VelenPublicWebCrawler|Webzio-Extended|YouBot)"){
    return 307 https://ash-speed.hetzner.com/10GB.bin;
}
#+end_src


Any bot that matches the above "user agent" will get redirected to ~https://ash-speed.hetzner.com/10GB.bin~.

For each ~server{...}~ entry under ~/etc/nginx/nginx.conf~ I then added the following line to include the above file.

#+begin_src
        include /etc/nginx/redirect.conf
#+end_src


Restart the server and test by changing the "user agent" in any browser to one that matches the above and I was asked if
I wanted to download a ~10GB.bin~ file.


** Dokuwiki

I use [[id:bc096b27-5f0e-426c-9722-7798e12ca2dc][Dokuwiki]] to host a couple of wiki's as its simple and doesn't require a database.

** Wordpress

I also (used to) host a Wordpress site with the intention of monetising my photography. Never got a single sale but I
keep the domain and one day I might update the installation and get it working again.

** LetsEncrypt

I use LetsEncrypt to provide certificates for my sites so they are secure.
