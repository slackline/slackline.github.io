Sometimes you have secrets such as API keys that may reside in files within your repository. Committing and pushing
these to a [[id:28ffcc43-9dff-4de8-a211-277c5346a642][Forge]] is a bad idea, they then become public and whilst it is possible to remove them using tools such as [[https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/][BFG
Repo Cleaner]] this is a bit of a pain and still leaves you having exposed your secrets for a period of time. Better to
avoid in the first place.

A useful tool with both a [[https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#github-action][GitHub Action]] and [[https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#pre-commit][Pre-Commit]] hook that allows you to check that secrets have not been added to
your repository.

You'd be best of using the [[https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#pre-commit][Pre-Commit]] hook to ensure you don't commit and push changes.
