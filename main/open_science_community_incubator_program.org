** Part I: Getting to know each other (10.00 - 10.40 CET)

** Break (10.40 -10.50 CET)

** Part II: Open Science: Establishing common ground (10.50 - 11.25 CET)
*** Why?
+ It is a means of achieving various different goals. No poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality
  educaiton, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable clean energy, decent work and economic growth,
  industry, innovation, etc. (see [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17dKDuuTOM5RWtWu87107FRJ2wJVKoFlDY717ilzrXlA/edit#slide=id.g13cef509449_0_557][slides]]).
+ UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science

  #+begin_quote
  ...open science is defined as an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make
  multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific
  collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of
  scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific
  community. It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied
  sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, …
  #+end_quote
+ Process /and/ open with working practices and results.
+ Not just about open access, we need to communicate the results as well as have well defined infrastructures to support
  the processes.
+ Discovery, Analysis, Writing, Publication, Outreach, Assessment, all of these phases of the research cycle have their
  defined and growing set of tools to support the process of making science open.
+ Five different schools of open science with different reasons...
  + Infrastructure
  + Public
  + Measurement
  + Democratic
  + Pragmatic
+ Shouldn't be too judgemental of others, whilst Open Science is "Just Science Done Right" we should encourage and not
  derided others for not fitting with our mental model of what it means.

*** Break out

**** What
+ Ines
Phases of research cycle should be open at all stages so that the creation of knowledge allows people to assess
research. Different people can have different roles and we work together as teams to accelerate the creation of
knowledge. Open collaboration.

+ Maya
Familiar with the Open Scientific knowledge, but keen to have open dialogue with other knowledge systems as this is
important to relate to others outside and within Science. Building bridges between the areas, finding common ground.

**** Why?
+ Maya
Wanting to bring the best of what we've experienced. Open Science is perhaps niche at the moment, but is growing, has
challenges though. Want to encourage the practice beyond the academic sphere.

+ Ines
Open Science results in more solid knowledge, it helps with introspection rather than focusing on the outputs. Being
aware of how we do science, and improving how we evaluate and assess research.

*** [[https://www.cos.io/blog/strategy-for-culture-change][Strategy for Culture Change]]

+ [[http://cos.io/][Centre for Open Science]] mission is to increase openness, integrity and reproducibility of research.
+ Behaviour change targets are to get researchers to show their work and to share.
+ Teams operate in isolation and don't share with each other what fails, this is to the detriment of Science.
+ Researchers should by default share materials, protocols and data for others to confirm, challenge, extend or reuse.
+ Values encapsulated by transparency, self-skepticism and reproducibility.
+ Current system maintains dysfunctional constellation of incentives and policies that are blocking widespread chnage
  toward showing and sharing work.
+ Bias in the reward system of science for...
  + Novel rather than incrementally build on or affirming existing findings.
  + Positive results rather than negative.
  + Fitting in with existing paradigms.
+ COS's strategy for culture and behaviour change requires five levels of intervention...

[[img/osc/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model.png]]


+ Higher levels build on lower levels
+ Tools need to be easy to use, [[https://osf.io][Open Science Framework (OSF)]] works with many popular services (e.g. GitHub). Can be
  private during work and integrates seamlessly with then being transparent and accessible (i.e. open).
+ Communities normalise behaviour, e.g. marking papers in journals that share their data and materials. When others see
  the behaviour they are more likely to adopt it.
+ Incentives and policy address the reward systems. Promote [[http://cos.io/rr/][Registered Reports]] where publication rests on the
  importance of the research question and the quality of the methodology. Encouraging existing journals to do this.

** **QUESTION** Open Science is perhaps excluding to humanities, is there scope for alternative names e.g. Open Research

** Talk 1
+ What is a community, "_a dynamic, social grouping where members align around a shared purposes (or multiple overlapping
  purposes) and participate in a shared culture. Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of
  belonging and affiliation to the community. IN a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members
  able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone._"
  + Shared goals
  + Sense of belonging
  + Connections
  + Opportunity
  The above encourage and enable people to take action.

*** What communities are you part of?
**** Me
  I go rock climbing and have a group of friends who I do this with that constitutes a small community.
  + Shared Purpose : Get outdoors and go and do pointless but fun things in unusual places. Learn from each other to
    improve safety and about techniques and places to go.
  + Belonging : very close bonds
  + Connected : metaphorically and literally (by the rope), putting your life in each others hands.

**** Maya
+ Non-profit community for PhD career development, taken a long time to get recognition.
+ Support group, multiple channels for interaction, MOOC, Discord, WhatsApp
+ Helps reduce and break out of isolation.
+ Shared purpose, support group
+ Belonging string during MOOC needs regular updating lot of work but sharing builds sense of community.
+ 12-15 people but have reach to a couple of thousand
+ Run every year (for seven years) keeps on growing, policy makers now interested.
**** Fuschia
+ Plant care community
+ Showing plants, passing on those that need specific care.
+ Share information and knowledge.
+ Meet people when passing/swapping plants.
+ Welcoming to immigrants who may have left plants behind
**** Vinodh
+ Online community with role models for LGBTQ+ scientists as not many role models.
+ Had been trying to organise an event in Edinburgh
+ Had to get visa to meet
+ More people able to join online as a consequence of pandemic.
+ Large groups have more influence on policy at institutions.
+ Develop documents.

*** Why Open Science Comunity
+ Need to change research culture to achieve open science


  [[./img/osc/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model.png]]

+ Communites make normative the process of Open Science, when people see others undertaking practices it encourages them
  to do so too.
+ Communities can't be built on their own by a few people. They are by researchers for researchers, support staff,
  policy makers, the builk is researchers themselves from all disciplines and career stages.
+ No need to have experience, willingness to learn is important as people share their experiences.
+ Can meet develop and articulate requirements and develop transitioning within the institution.
+ Also requires interacting with wider community and society.
+ Innovation adoption always takes time, small group of innovators, some early adopters, the early majority, but reach
  towards the late majority and laggards. Different strategies required to get the early/late majority on-board.
+ Aims of OSC
  + Reach and engage researchers to learn about OS. Make people aware of the community.
  + Inspire and enable them to adopt OS.
  + Empower and support to shape transition and participate.
+ Science is international so need to build worldwide network.

**Question** Why "Science" rather than "Research" when humanities could benefit from this.

Its the most broadly used term internationality but its meant in the broader sense of including those who aren't
traditionally seen as "science" stick to scholarship/ research otherwise the acronym doesn't work.

** Five minutes of silent note taking
What aspects of talk are inspiring, did you like/dislike and hope to learn.

+ Hope to learn how to connect to people. Its clear that there is motivation to move towards open science but research
  groups are small and often work in isolation, what sort of events can be undertaken to start encouraging change? I
  guess one possible might be to hold local seminars showcasing a particular piece of work that has been done in an open
  manner to show how it can be done. This demonstrates the sharing of information and moves towards normalising the
  practice (Neil)
+ I liked the emphasis on including the wider community/society in the process. There is little point in hacking away at
  research if its utility and value to society can not be conveyed to those who might benefit. (Neil)

+ I like the pyramid from Brian Nosek's paper, its well thought out and structured and shows how community building fits
  into the wider framework (Neil).
+ One minor concern is the focus on Open _Science_ as it may make those engaged in non-scientific research such as
  humanities feel unwelcome. Perhaps a focus on Open _Research_ would be more welcoming and all-encompassing.

** Mission and Vision
[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hlcd91XUNINR-K-TcKmhvx06dF_EcebW60T54jNb2lY/edit#slide=id.g13cef509449_0_534][Slides]]
+ Vision : Ideal, where you want to go (mission accomplished), focused on the Why
+ Mission : Purpose, how to get there, focused on the How

+  Vision is where, mission is how to get there.
*** Co-create
Vision : Open science is the norm for researchers at The University of Sheffield (and beyond!)
Mission : Develop and share good working practices that enable open science to be undertaken by anyone. Providing a
support network for participants so they can embrace these practices and produce open research,

We have many resources available for undertaking open research but not everyone is familiar with or comfortable with the
tools, for example using Git/GitHub for developing and sharing code for software or statistical analysis, using HPC
systems to undertake large scaling computer modelling.

By building a community to share information between those who are already familiar with different aspects of the
process we teach and learn from each other and enable the process of moving towards open science.

** Homework (Due [2023-03-15 Wed])

*** OSC Master Plan (Deadline: 1 week after the meet-up)
**** Minimal Viable Community Checklist
+ Fill in the status column of your ‘Minimal Viable Community Checklist’ in your OSC Master Plan and formulate and plan
  actions towards your Minimal Viable Community (actions go in the ‘List of Milestones and Actions’ in your OSC Master
  Plan).
**** Vision and Mission
+ Revisit the Vision and Mission statements that you collectively drafted during the online meet-up. Does it fit your
  local context? Make adjustments where necessary.
+ Break-down your Mission statement into a set of actionable goals or aims. For an example, see the Open Science
  Community Starter Kit, section I.II.
+ Add the Vision and Mission statement to your OSC Master Plan
** Check-in [2023-03-15 Wed 09:00]
Questions to discuss...
+ Easy or difficult?
+ Any obstacles? How to overcome
+ Any new insights?

*** Neil
+ Not an easy task as thinking about community building and organising people isn't something that I normally do.
+ I found expanding on the vision to a mission statement somewhat tricky and have somewhat stalled on that at present.
*** Vinodh
+ Contacting people who are interested in this may be tricky.
+ Clear communication plan is important.
*** Sanna
+ Many researchers don't have the time to work on/be involved whilst the Library is trying to form policy and have it
  informed from the Open Science Community
*** Fostis
+ Librarian by background and understands the challenge between the library and research community.
+ Practical issues of who runs the social media profiles.
+ An Open Science award for the community.
+ Tagged things into groups/areas : Motivation, Skills, Training, Environment, Governance

+ Communities are where people interact.
+ Different target audiences for Open Science Communities with different levels of engagement.
+ Who are our members, what type of groups?
+ A community has...
  + Shared Goals
  + Sense of Belonging
  + Connections
  + Opportunity
  + ...all lead to Action.
+ Helps to have a heterogenous community so that people do not feel excluded.
  + Open Science expertise varies
  + Professional roles
  + Disciplines (Science, Humanities, Maths)
  + Bear in mind the mission and vision statements.

** Mountain of Engagement
People can be active and participate in different manners within a community.
+ Want to make the community such that people can move up the mountain of engagement, don't want people just attending,
  we want people to then get involved and share/teach others.
+ 5 steps of Mountain engagement...
  1. A list of peoples interactions within your community.
  2. 3-5 deepening bands/levels of engagement
  3. Group interactions into bands and give each band a name.
  4. Identify what works and what doesn't work.
  5. Prioritise your work to create more opportunities.

*** Levels of Community Interaction (Brainstorming)
See [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clV_gk0IV3jKsUSN0_M1C4uohz7_V0SsQZpn1p7RsxY/edit][Group Notes]]

| Levels of Engagement | Description                                                   | Community Interactions |

| Initiator            | Starts things themselves, good idea to have a workshop/group. | Organising OS Workshops for their research group |
| Participator         | Active in discussion, member of working group.                | Share exepereinces, setting up infrastructure |
| Learner              | Attends events, but is passive.                               |                        |
| Endorser             | Agrees and supports the community.                            |                        |


Useful to monitor how people have engaged

+ Who has moved up, how they moved up, what worked for them?
+ Who gets stuck and why?

**** Community Interactions
+ **Gifting** - Information is shared
+ **Creating Together** - People come together to create something.
+ **Soliciting Ideas** - Input from others to develop
+ **Learning Through Use** Doing, practical examples.
+ **Networking Common Interests** - Meeting with stakeholders.

*** The Power of Peer-to-Peer
+ Less intimidating to learn from others and lowers threshold to ask for help.
+ Experience is more important than expertise.
+ Practical aspect is often more beneficial than theoretical.
+ More specific the more useful. Give examples of how to deposit data in a specific repository. (e.g. workshop on using
  ORDA).
+ Members are more important than you, they are what makes the community.
+ OpenFest2023 will be really important, its a forum where people are sharing their experiences.
+ Are people sharing their experiences of things like publishing?
+ Reuse material (if licensed to do so), see resources at [[https://osf.io/vz2sy/][International Network of Open Science & Scholarship Communities]]
+ Looking for a speaker, use INOSC to look for a speaker

Communicating with members as well as communicating and attracting new members.

Aims
+ Establish Community Identity
+ Complete plan to attract members having formulated a plan to reach out to target groups
+ Describe the pathway of reaching and on-boarding new members.

** Exercise 1

+ Picked Volkswagen.
+ Found them more subtle rather than Pepsi which were more brash.
+ Better story telling, brand was almost an aside.
+ Volkswagen adverts had dogs in, perhaps trying to appeal to a particular demographic. In a similar vein Pepsi was
  appealing to healthy lifestyle.
+ Identifying values of the target group and work out how to communicate and appeal to these groups.

*** What worked
+ Focus on the brand itself
+ Try to connect to people who you are targetting.
+ Connection with climate crisis
+ Who controls the power
+ More subtle
+ Storytelling elements
+ Values were clearly communicated
+ Humor
+ Counterintuitive messaging, flipping things around, surprise elements.

** Getting people to sign up to OSC
*** Receiver
the person getting the message, and the intended response is that they will join your OSC
*** Sender
+ Who is sending it.
+ What is the message
+ What is the medium

Incorporate the above associations in the branding and messages we put out. Always check what others reactions are when
they read or see messages.

+ Online and Offline visibility.
+ Tone of voice.
+ Familiarity and reputation (comes with time as community grows and evolves).

Choice of events to be included is important as it sets the brand of your community and could deter people from
thinking it its relevant to them and reduce inclusive. Its about telling a story of your mission statement.

*** Message

Value Proposition - what do you have to offer?
+ Sense of belonging
+ Power to be heard
+ Access to knowledge
+ Networking
+ Statement or status (being visible as part of the community)

*** Medium
+ Word of mouth
+ Flyers
+ Presentations
+ Website
+ Blog/vlog
+ Social media

**** AIDA
Steps of message, medium, receiver...

+ Attention/Awareness
+ Interest
+ Desire
+ Action

*** Marketing by community members
Word of mouth is very powerful.
+ Add note in email signature.
+ Mention OSC in meetings
+ Mail department(s)/colleagues.
+ Mailing lists

Important to remember that the landscape of science is changing internationally and the movement towards Open Science is
growing.

Remember to get participants to promote the Open Science Community as its the most effective method (word of mouth)

** Stakeholder mapping
+ Who are they
  + Local, national and international.
  + Local most important when starting, people have different goals, sometimes they align, sometimes they don't.
  + We can offer and gain from stakeholders.
  + Need to establish and maintain the communication channels.

** Website Structure

Purpose of OSC website
+ Post news and events for your community to advertise and share information and resources.
+ Federated web-sites, shared across communities, local > national > international.
+ Something we can tap into, has News/Events/Contact form.
+ Can list members, but not yet their knowledge/experience area.
+ Can setup URLs to redirect to the site, e.g. https://osc.shef.ac.uk/ would redirect there.
+ Developed by [[mailto:ron@ultraprobaat.nl][Ron Hol]]
+ Wordpress Site so extensible
  **QUESTION** Can this host the pages of peoples profiles that shows who at a given institution has what knowledge/experience
  **QUESTION** How does INOSC pages link in with institution advertising?

** Monitoring
*** Why Monitor?
+ Check whether you are doing a good job, assess success and identify areas for improvement.
+ Feedback and adjust engagement ([[id:b867820e-85f0-4666-b572-84ac2dead954][Module 2]]) and communication strategies ([[id:cda2f6a6-bbc1-4a04-9eab-5611699a23d4][Module 3]])
+ Sets out what is important.
+ Makes external communication easier (i.e. funders).
*** What to Monitor?
+ Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
+ Quantification of success.
+ Linked to the aims ([[id:8b8c0382-09f1-442c-a1c4-b7ea179638f9][Module 1]])
+ Number of members
+ Event attendance
+ Interactions with stakeholders/members
+ Behaviour change (normalisation is hard to quantify), so use proxies.
*** How to Monitor?
+ Sign-up information (diversity, area, expertise experience).
+ Interviews and focus groups.
+ Feedback forms and surveys
+ Important to talk to members.
*** Annual Reports
+ Useful to re-iterate the goals and aims of the community, what has been learnt and where new directions will be
  going.
** Sustainability
+ Make OSC future proof.
+ Success is when a project continues after you leave.
+ Where is your community in 1, 5 years?
+ How to turn potential into reality?
+ Secure capacity (funding) for subsequent stages.
+ Be ambitious but realistic, /with our resources I can do.../ these should be linked to the aims and KPI.
+ Important to make effective use of the time people are willing to commit to the community and "manage" them (the
  /Mountain of Engagement/)
*** Funding
+ Can be challenging, ideally support from local institute.
+ Contingent on local context.
+ Collaborate in joint grant proposals.
+ OSC Masterplan and an introduction with clear goals and aims of what is to be achieved is pretty much the structure of
  a grant proposal and provides an excellent starting point.

*** Plan
Align the KPI with the aspects of Engagement, attracting members, stakeholders, monitoring and so forth.
