** Part I: Getting to know each other (10.00 - 10.40 CET)

** Break (10.40 -10.50 CET)

** Part II: Open Science: Establishing common ground (10.50 - 11.25 CET)
*** Why?
+ It is a means of achieving various different goals. No poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality
  educaiton, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable clean energy, decent work and economic growth,
  industry, innovation, etc. (see [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17dKDuuTOM5RWtWu87107FRJ2wJVKoFlDY717ilzrXlA/edit#slide=id.g13cef509449_0_557][slides]]).
+ UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science

  #+begin_quote
  ...open science is defined as an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make
  multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific
  collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of
  scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific
  community. It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied
  sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, â€¦
  #+end_quote
+ Process /and/ open with working practices and results.
+ Not just about open access, we need to communicate the results as well as have well defined infrastructures to support
  the processes.
+ Discovery, Analysis, Writing, Publication, Outreach, Assessment, all of these phases of the research cycle have their
  defined and growing set of tools to support the process of making science open.
+ Five different schools of open science with different reasons...
  + Infrastructure
  + Public
  + Measurement
  + Democratic
  + Pragmatic
+ Shouldn't be too judgemental of others, whilst Open Science is "Just Science Done Right" we should encourage and not
  derided others for not fitting with our mental model of what it means.

*** Break out

**** What
+ Ines
Phases of research cycle should be open at all stages so that the creation of knowledge allows people to assess
research. Different people can have different roles and we work together as teams to accelerate the creation of
knowledge. Open collaboration.

+ Maya
Familiar with the Open Scientific knowledge, but keen to have open dialogue with other knowledge systems as this is
important to relate to others outside and within Science. Building bridges between the areas, finding common ground.

**** Why?
+ Maya
Wanting to bring the best of what we've experienced. Open Science is perhaps niche at the moment, but is growing, has
challenges though. Want to encourage the practice beyond the academic sphere.

+ Ines
Open Science results in more solid knowledge, it helps with introspection rather than focusing on the outputs. Being
aware of how we do science, and improving how we evaluate and assess research.
** Silent note-taking: Part II

*** [[https://www.cos.io/blog/strategy-for-culture-change][Strategy for Culture Change]]

+ [[http://cos.io/][Centre for Open Science]] mission is to increase openness, integrity and reproducibility of research.
+ Behaviour change targets are to get researchers to show their work and to share.
+ Teams operate in isolation and don't share with each other what fails, this is to the detriment of Science.
+ Researchers should by default share materials, protocols and data for others to confirm, challenge, extend or reuse.
+ Values encapsulated by transparency, self-skepticism and reproducibility.
+ Current system maintains dysfunctional constellation of incentives and policies that are blocking widespread chnage
  toward showing and sharing work.
+ Bias in the reward system of science for...
  + Novel rather than incrementally build on or affirming existing findings.
  + Positive results rather than negative.
  + Fitting in with existing paradigms.
+ COS's strategy for culture and behaviour change requires five levels of intervention...

[[img/osc/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model.png]]


+ Higher levels build on lower levels
+ Tools need to be easy to use, [[https://osf.io][Open Science Framework (OSF)]] works with many popular services (e.g. GitHub). Can be
  private during work and integrates seamlessly with then being transparent and accessible (i.e. open).
+ Communities normalise behaviour, e.g. marking papers in journals that share their data and materials. When others see
  the behaviour they are more likely to adopt it.
+ Incentives and policy address the reward systems. Promote [[http://cos.io/rr/][Registered Reports]] where publication rests on the
  importance of the research question and the quality of the methodology. Encouraging existing journals to do this.

** **QUESTION** Open Science is perhaps excluding to humanities, is there scope for alternative names e.g. Open Research

** Talk 1
+ What is a community, "_a dynamic, social grouping where members align around a shared (or multiple overlapping)
  purposes and participate in a shared culture. Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of
  belinging and affiliation to the community. IN a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members
  able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone._"
  + Shared goals
  + Sense of belonging
  + Connections
  + Opportunity
  The above encourage and enable people to take action.

*** What communities are you part of?
**** Me
  I go rock climbing and have a group of friends who I do this with that constitutes a small community.
  + Shared Purpose : Get outdoors and go and do pointless but fun things in unusual places. Learn from each other to
    improve safety and about techniques and places to go.
  + Belonging : very close bonds
  + Connected : metaphorically and literally (by the rope), putting your life in each others hands.

**** Maya
+ Non-profit community for PhD career development, taken a long time to get recognition.
+ Support group, multiple channels for interaction, MOOC, Discord, WhatsApp
+ Helps reduce and break out of isolation.
+ Shared purpose, support group
+ Belonging string during MOOC needs regular updating lot of work but sharing builds sense of community.
+ 12-15 people but have reach to a couple of thousand
+ Run every year (for seven years) keeps on growing, policy makers now interested.
**** Fuschia
+ Plant care community
+ Showing plants, passing on those that need specific care.
+ Share information and knowledge.
+ Meet people when passing/swapping plants.
+ Welcoming to immigrants who may have left plants behind
**** Vinodh
+ Online community with role models for LGBTQ+ scientists as not many role models.
+ Had been trying to organise an event in Edinburgh
+ Had to get visa to meet
+ More people able to join online as a consequence of pandemic.
+ Large groups have more influence on policy at institutions.
+ Develop documents.

*** Why Open Science Comunity
+ Need to change research culture to achieve open science


  [[./img/osc/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model.png]]

+ Communites make normative the process of Open Science, when people see others undertaking practices it encourages them
  to do so too.
+ Communities can't be built on their own by a few people. They are by researchers for researchers, support staff,
  policy makers, the builk is researchers themselves from all disciplines and career stages.
+ No need to have experience, willingness to learn is important as people share their experiences.
+ Can meet develop and articulate requirements and develop transitioning within the institution.
+ Also requires interacting with wider community and society.
+ Innovation adoption always takes time, small group of innovators, some early adopters, the early majority, but reach
  towards the late majority and laggards. Different strategies required to get the early/late majority on-board.
+ Aims of OSC
  + Reach and engage researchers to learn about OS. Make people aware of the community.
  + Inspire and enable them to adopt OS.
  + Empower and support to shape transition and participate.
+ Science is international so need to build worldwide network.

**Question** Why "Science" rather than "Research" when humanities could benefit from this.

Its the most broadly used term internationality but its meant in the broader sense of including those who aren't
traditionally seen as "science" stick to scholarship/ research otherwise the acronym doesn't work.

** Five minutes of silent note taking
What aspects of talk are inspiring, did you like/dislike and hope to learn.

+ Hope to learn how to connect to people. Its clear that there is motivation to move towards open science but research
  groups are small and often work in isolation, what sort of events can be undertaken to start encouraging change? I
  guess one possible might be to hold local seminars showcasing a particular piece of work that has been done in an open
  manner to show how it can be done. This demonstrates the sharing of information and moves towards normalising the
  practice (Neil)
+ I liked the emphasis on including the wider community/society in the process. There is little point in hacking away at
  research if its utility and value to society can not be conveyed to those who might benefit. (Neil)

+ I like the pyramid from Brian Nosek's paper, its well thought out and structured and shows how community building fits
  into the wider framework (Neil).
+ One minor concern is the focus on Open _Science_ as it may make those engaged in non-scientific research such as
  humanities feel unwelcome. Perhaps a focus on Open _Research_ would be more welcoming and all-encompassing.

** Mission and Vision
[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hlcd91XUNINR-K-TcKmhvx06dF_EcebW60T54jNb2lY/edit#slide=id.g13cef509449_0_534][Slides]]
+ Vision : Ideal, where you want to go (mission accomplished), focused on the Why
+ Mission : Purpose, how to get there, focused on the How

+  Vision is where, mission is how to get there.
*** Co-create
Vision : Open science is the norm for researchers at The University of Sheffield (and beyond!)
Mission : Develop and share good working practices that enable open science to be undertaken by anyone. Providing a
support network for participants so they can embrace these practices and produce open research,

We have many resources available for undertaking open research but not everyone is familiar with or comfortable with the
tools, for example using Git/GitHub for developing and sharing code for software or statistical analysis, using HPC
systems to undertake large scaling computer modelling.

By building a community to share information between those who are already familiar with different aspects of the
process we teach and learn from each other and enable the process of moving towards open science.

  actions towards your Minimal Viable Community (actions go in the â€˜List of Milestones and Actionsâ€™ in your OSC Master
  Plan).
**** Vision and Mission
+ Revisit the Vision and Mission statements that you collectively drafted during the online meet-up. Does it fit your
  local context? Make adjustments where necessary.
+ Break-down your Mission statement into a set of actionable goals or aims. For an example, see the Open Science
  Community Starter Kit, section I.II.
+ Add the Vision and Mission statement to your OSC Master Plan
** Check-in [2023-03-15 Wed 09:00]

*** Neil
+ Not an easy task as thinking about community building and organising people isn't something that I normally do.
+ I found expanding on the vision to a mission statement somewhat tricky and have somewhat stalled on that at present.
*** Vinodh
+ Contacting people who are interested in this may be tricky.
+ Clear communication plan is important.
*** Sanna
+ Many researchers don't have the time to work on/be involved whilst the Library is trying to form policy and have it
  informed from the Open Science Community
*** Fostis
+ Librarian by background and understands the challenge between the library and research community.
+ Practical issues of who runs the social media profiles.
+ An Open Science award for the community.
+ Tagged things into groups/areas : Motivation, Skills, Training, Environment, Governance
