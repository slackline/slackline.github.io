** Part I: Getting to know each other (10.00 - 10.40 CET)

** Break (10.40 -10.50 CET)

** Part II: Open Science: Establishing common ground (10.50 - 11.25 CET)
*** Why?
+ It is a means of achieving various different goals. No poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality
  educaiton, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable clean energy, decent work and economic growth,
  industry, innovation, etc. (see [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17dKDuuTOM5RWtWu87107FRJ2wJVKoFlDY717ilzrXlA/edit#slide=id.g13cef509449_0_557][slides]]).
+ UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science

  #+begin_quote
  ...open science is defined as an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make
  multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific
  collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of
  scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific
  community. It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied
  sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, â€¦
  #+end_quote
+ Process /and/ open with working practices and results.
+ Not just about open access, we need to communicate the results as well as have well defined infrastructures to support
  the processes.
+ Discovery, Analysis, Writing, Publication, Outreach, Assessment, all of these phases of the research cycle have their
  defined and growing set of tools to support the process of making science open.
+ Five different schools of open science with different reasons...
  + Infrastructure
  + Public
  + Measurement
  + Democratic
  + Pragmatic
+ Shouldn't be too judgemental of others, whilst Open Science is "Just Science Done Right" we should encourage and not
  derided others for not fitting with our mental model of what it means.

*** Break out

**** What
+ Ines
Phases of research cycle should be open at all stages so that the creation of knowledge allows people to assess
research. Different people can have different roles and we work together as teams to accelerate the creation of
knowledge. Open collaboration.

+ Maya
Familiar with the Open Scientific knowledge, but keen to have open dialogue with other knowledge systems as this is
important to relate to others outside and within Science. Building bridges between the areas, finding common ground.

**** Why?
+ Maya
Wanting to bring the best of what we've experienced. Open Science is perhaps niche at the moment, but is growing, has
challenges though. Want to encourage the practice beyond the academic sphere.

+ Ines
Open Science results in more solid knowledge, it helps with introspection rather than focusing on the outputs. Being
aware of how we do science, and improving how we evaluate and assess research.
** Silent note-taking: Part II

  + Launch Event
** Silent note-taking: Part III
+ Hope to Learn : Aspects of open science that I'm not so familiar with such as community engagement, science communication, greater
  transparency of the research process.
+ Looking forward to : Spending time learning something new, getting to know new people.
+ What did you like : Good pace to the introduction module, nice to have a breakout early and start getting to know
  others on the course.
+ What inspired you : Everyone's enthusiasm.
+ What did you dislike : Nothing
