#+TITLE: Magit Stash
#+FILETAGS: :magit:git:stashing:

Stashing from Magit is soooo simple, just hit ~z~ and a transient appears with all your options.

Sometimes you'll only want to stash unstaged changes, e.g. if you are doing a partial commit and have staged a bunch of
sections that you want to lint. This is simple ~z w~ (akin to ~git stash push --keep-index~ which isn't very easy to
remember, but then the description in the [[https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Stashing.html][Magit manual]] requires that you know the difference between ~index~ and
~worktree~ too!).
