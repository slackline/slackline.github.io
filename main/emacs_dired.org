* Working with Files

** Filename Editing

You can edit filenames using ~C-x C-q~ and edit the filename in place (e.g. ~M-$~ to spellcheck), when done you confirm
the filename change with ~C-c C-c~ ([[https://mbork.pl/2023-01-30_The_benefits_of_everything_being_a_buffer][source]]).

This is particularly useful if you've a bunch of files with a common prefix that you want to remove (e.g. downloads from
[[https://bandcamp.com][Bandcamp]] that all have the artist and album prefix). Fire up the buffer use ~C-x SPACE~ to start rectangle select and
select the prefixes you want to remove.

** Compression

You can (un)compress files or directory in Dired by hitting `Z`.
