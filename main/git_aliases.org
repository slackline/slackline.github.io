#+TITLE: Git Aliases
#+FILETAGS: :git:versioncontrol:aliases:shell:

Git has its own system for aliasing common commands, for now refer to the article on Git Blame ([[https://ns-rse.github.io/posts/whos_to_blame/][Whoâ€™s to Blame]]) for
examples of how to use aliases.

* Shell Aliases

It's useful to be aware of the options that are available to you for formatting your logs, but it can be cumbersome to
memorise them, particularly so when often your primary focus is on getting work done rather than becoming an expert in
the tools you use. To which end using [[id:c7d811f9-5e9f-43b9-9b0b-d647a399756c][Bash aliases]] to provide shortcuts to the formatting you want is invaluable. The
[[id:a1b78518-31e8-4fd3-a36f-d8f152832138][zsh]] shell comes with a bundle of aliases pre-configured, typically I just use ~glod~ which shows the graph in short
form, but you may find others to be more suited to your preferences, and if not you can always specify your own.
