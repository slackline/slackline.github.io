[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System][Domain Name System]] (DNS) is the protocol that translates IP addresses into domain names, the human readable form of
web-addresses. Traditionally these are transmitted in "plain-text" and so third parties can snoop on what sites you
are looking at. Thankfully these days there are a number of ways to ensure that such data is encrypted during transit
and the information about what sites you are browsing remains private.
