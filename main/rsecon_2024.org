* Day 1

** Welcome

+ 10 principles of RSE from Neil last year (look these up).

** Anne-Marie Imafidon - RSE Community : the transition to the teenage years?

+ [[https://stemettes.org][STEMETTES]] - supporting 15-25 year old women in STEM.

Advice...

1. Plan for your future but enjoy the present
2. Be mindful of your online presence
  + Find your way to be visible both Internally & Externally
  + Recognise and use your influence
  + Book to read [[https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Caroline-Criado-Perez/Invisible-Women--Exposing-Data-Bias-in-a-World-Designed-for-Men/24936045][/Invisible Women/]], /Stay in Your Lane/, /Demanding More/.
3. Learn from your mistakes.
  + Embrace the experimentation of the 'awkward' phase - Build, Measure, Learn/Iterate
  + Track feedback, measure your impact and Iterate a Theory of Change.
4. Respect yourself and others.
  + Celebrate difference internally, conforming is not the destination.
  + Angus Maguire Interaction Institute for Social Change - [[https://institutionaldiversityblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Equality-Equity-Reality-Liberation_Artist-Angus-Maguire.jpg][Equality, equity, reality, liberation]]
  + [[https://yestem.org][Yestem.org]]
  + [[https://www.ifow.org/][Institute for the Future of Work]]
5. Build resilience
  + Who has a stake in your success?
  + Have a growth mindset - magic happens outside of your comfort zone.
  + Strength in numbers and *alumni*.

** Muzlifah Haniffa — The role of RSE in accelerating clinical translation of biomedical research

+ DNA sequencing was a transformative technology, complete the Human Genome Project in 2003 and variation is in this is
  what underlies many diseases.
+ Gene expression within single cells allowed single cell genomics amd multi-omic profiling of proteins (m)RNA epigenome
  and so forth.
+ Resolution revolution allowed the profiling of these /in-istu/
+ All this information Li, Horsfall et al. Nature Methods 2024
+ Cell Atlas Technologies - [[htts://humancellatlas.org/join-hca][The Human Cell Atlas]]
+ Atlas allows investigation of disease.
+ Exceptional amount of data and a useful resource but need to extract knowledge and meaning.
+ Sungnal 2020 - allows profiling of cells that had receptors for SARS-CoV-2 to bind and enter the cells/body, not
  just the oral system but also cornea and conjunctiva.
+ Look at gene expression for disease profiling, e.g. blood clotting.
+ Look at drug and cell type interactions, identifying where drugs are absorbed.
+ Can grow cells.
+ Hiddent Opportunity - Visible data and sharing of raw data files, need computing infrastructure along with data
  analysis and coding skills.
+ Hidden Insights are currently locked - need global equity, intuitive and accessible , interactive visualisation. Need
  Internet, computer/smartphone to democratise data. This accelerates clinical translation
+ RSE sits in between bioinformatics and data generation and helps make data access FAIR and equitable. [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02353-0][Horsfall et al
  Nature Medicine 2023]]
+ [[https://rse.ncldata.dev][Mark Turner]]
+ [[https://haniffalab.com/][@HaniffaLab]] - Training (coding, tools, documentation guides), Pipelines (streamline analysis and reproducibility), Web
  Portals (key)
+ WebAtlas is an easy way of working with this and integrates with DECIPHER a database of clinical disorders
  [[https://CellAtlas.io][CellAtlas.io]]
+ Build on existing infrastructure (EMBI, BioConductor etc.)

** Robert Chisholm - Performant Python Patterns: Small changes to speed up your Python code

+ Many researchers write code but don't have the technical and formal training.

+ Poor performance matters
  + Reduces productivity (time spent waiting
  + Increased Energy Usage
  + Reduces Availability (huggin resources)
+ Profiling and optimisation should be inexpensive
+ Performance should be reasonable
+ Should be time consuming to catch the big stuff
+ Profile a reduced typical workload
+ Do the results match your assumptions?
  + If not we learn.

*** Interactive Session
**** Logical ~in~ list
+ Rather than looping over to test whether something is in a list use ~in~ it offers a x2 speed up

**** Lists
+ List comprehensino is faster (x2.26) than preallocation to a list/array and appending is by far the slowest.

**** Uniques

+ Sets are incredibly useful
+ Iterate through a list
**** Tuples

+ Tuples can be a lot faster than lists.

**** Scope
+ Python has four levels of scope, local, enclosing, global and built-in.
+ When writing classes not everything needs to be a ~self~ as this adds overhead to looking up.

**** NumPy

+ Arrays are a lot faster.
+ Where possible pass in arrays, not lists to NumPy functions, it will do the conversion on the fly, but that means you
  have to set things up in advance.
+ Use ~numpy.dot()~ when multiplying arrays, backed by BLAS/LAPACK and may benefit from auto-parallelisation on HPC.
+ Pandas columns are typically NumPy arrays.
+ If vectorisation isn't possible then conversion to dictionaries can be a lot faster.

**** Numba

+ If all else fails then consider adding Numba to your code base.

**** Python

+ Keep Python up-to-date there are continual improvements 3.10 > 3.11 25% speed up.

Question - how do we encourage colleagues and researchers to keep up-to-date?

High Performance Python 2nd Edition


** Prasad Sutar - OpenGHG

+ Multiple sensort networks measuring various gases around the country and internationally, provides the data in
  multiple formats.
+ Can it be shared? What is the licensing?
+ [[https://openghg.github.io/decc_dashboard/][DECC Network Dashboard]]
+ Data often shared originally via zip files/Dropbox
+ OpenGHG allows interacting with the multiple networks and different data formats from each site.
+ Data is wrangled and converted to internal format which can be stored as netcdf/hd5/excel/csv

*** Data Objects
+ Serve as a foundation for detailed analysis and visualisation.
+ Stored in the form of data sources.
+ Conduct Forward Analysis on the greenhouse gas emissions.
+ Easy to add custom data processing modules
+ Compare surface, mobile, aircraft and satellite data.
+ Interact with multiple stores at once.

*** Data Sources

+ Data has three dimensions, lat, lon and date/time.
+ Users can query by site and gas type (species) and inlet.

*** Zarr Backend

+ Allows chunking of data across multiplee dimensions and controls the maximum amount of memory used to store the data,
  reduced memory usage by 99.93%!!!
+ [[https://zarr.dev/][Zarr]]

*** ObsPacks

+ Standardised data output.s

*** Greenhouse Gas Emissions Measurement and Modelling Advancement (GEMMA)

*** Principles in Focus

+ responsible
+ FAIR
+ Open

*** WIP

+ Allow more labelling of data sources by users
+ Moving config file setup to YAML
+ Aiming for expandability
+ https://openghg.org / https://github.com/openghg


** Abhishek Dasgupta - Advanced Python Testing - mocking, property based testing, snapshot testing

[[https://github.com/abhidg/advanced-python-testing][abhidg/advanced-python-testing]] code and slides from the talk

*** Mocking

+ Test the code without the underlying code being run.
+ Useful when testing the actual interface is...
  + time consuming
  + requites network access
  + not possible in an automated way
+ *Pros* : reproducibility, easy to setup.
+ *Cons* : hidden behvaiour isn't exposed
+ Alternatives : use docker to setup the infrastructure

**** ~unittest.mock~

+ Built-int
+ Mock return values of your functions.
+ Assert the function called with certain values returns the mocked value.
+ Raise exceptions through side-effects.

#+begin_src python
f
#+end_src
)
*** Property Based Testing

+ Checks that a particular property is satisfied by the code.
+ Similar to fuzzing which tests a system with random inputs.
+ Normally you have parameterised based tests.
+ Cons of example based testing is not being exhaustive enough.
+ Often miss edge cases.
+ Applications : test input sanitisation, encode/decode round trips.
+ Use the [[https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][hypothesis]] and use the ~@given()~ decorator to pass in ~hypothesis.strategies~ such as ~floats~ and ~integers~
  and these can be combined to build more complex examples.
+ Use ~try: except: hypothesis.reject()~ to capture errors that are raised when invalid values are given.

from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis.strategies import float, integers

*** Snapshot Testing

+ Snapshots output of a function or process.
+ Useful for regression testing and data transformationcs
+ Avoids writing to disk, reading and testing that ist is the same.
+ Use the [[https://syrupy-project.github.io/syrupy/][~syrupy~]] library for this.

[[https://pytest-mock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][pytest-mock documentation]]

** Nicholas Tierney - A gentle guide to using the ~{targets}~ package for analytic pipelines

+ [[https://njtierney.github.io/gentle-intro-targets/#/title-slide][A gentle guide to using the {targets} package for analytic pipelines]]
+ [[https://github.com/njtierney/gentle-intro-targets][njtierney/gentle-intro-targets]]

*** Motivation

+ Data analysis is interactive and messu.
+ How to know if it is up-to-date? Better-re-run...
+ Months later, how did you do things? Better-re-run...
+ Thinking about data analysis deserves inherent structure.
+ Always collaborating with your future self.
+ ~{targets}~ is a way to manage complexity.
+ It's also a change in mindset.

*** Walk-through

+ Uses the [[https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/][palmerpenguins R data package • palmerpenguins]]
+ Build a logistic regression model.
+ [[https://github.com/MilesMcBain/fnmate][MilesMcBain/fnmate: A function definition generator.]] useful for defining function templates
+ By writing a template with functions you setup in advance the pipeline and think about what you are going to do it
  helps plan out intent.

*** Takeaways

+ No problem is too small for ~{targets}~
+ Use ~{tflow}~ package to setup a project to use ~{targets}~.

** Effortlessly creating Python packages with good practices

[[https://hackmd.io/@pBkWTvQwSa6d52OQUwKE6g/BktUdXQ20][Feedback for RSECon24 workshop: Effortlessly creating Python packages with good practices]]

** Carlos Martinez-Ortiz - Good Cookies are made with good cookie cutters: Use research software templates to kick-start your research software

+ New project == new repository.
+ Good practices are important...
  + Version control
  + License
  + CITATION.cff
  + Documentation
  + Testing
  + CI
  + Code of Conduct
  + Contributing guidelines
  + Styling
+ There is a lot of boiler plate code to set up for a new project, use a cookiecutter to create templates for software
  projects.
+ [[https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template][NLeSC/python-template]] didn't quite solve all problems...
  + Other languages
  + Not suitable for all projects had some smaller projects which didn't want to use templates
  + Low adoption rates.
  + [[https://github.com/abelsiqueira/BestieTemplate.jl][abelsiqueira/BestieTemplate.jl: Template for Julia Programming Language packages using the copier engine.]]
  + [[https://usethis.r-lib.org/][Automate Package and Project Setup • usethis]] is useful for setting up R packages.
+ Ideally we should have a standardised template.
  + Modular
  + Scalable
  + Community ownership
  + Connected to software management plans

+ Collaborative Lesson Development Training for RSEs (Toby Hodges)

** Thomas Hawes - An Introduction to Test Driven Development

+ [[https://github.com/UniExeterRSE/rsecon24-tdd-workshop][UniExeterRSE/rsecon24-tdd-workshop: Materials to support the workshop, An Introduction to Test-Driven Development, at
  RSECon 2024]]
+ Tony Hawes has been practising TDD for 2-4 years.

Agenda...

+ Basic TDD Workflow
+ Live-code and example and exercise
+ Closing thoughts; benefits and challenges

*** What is TDD?
+ Interleaves
  1. Writing tests
  2. Writing production code
+ Writing tests provides feedback on design.
+ Iterate over the Red/Green/Refactor cycle
  1. Write a failing test.
  2. Make the test pass (minimal amount of code to get test pass on first instance).
  3. Refactor to clean design.

Sensible to write a requirement/specifiction (or GitHub issue!) that defines the requirements/specification for the code
and in turn guides the tests that are being written.

+ Need to think about the format in which things are being returned.
+ Don't let new ideas about tests interrupt your current work flow, instead note it and do it later.

Proponents claim Test Driven Development it

1. Results in feweer bugs
2. Leads to improved design (easier to maintain/change)
3. Is more productive in the long run due to 1. and 2.

Research on these claims is inconclusive though.

+ Splits "working code" from "clean code"
+ Establishes a rhythm and brings focus
+ API and design merge, no need to know it all up-front.

*** Challenges
+ Not suitable in all cases, e.g.
  + Difficult/impossible to write tests (e.g. often UIs)
  + Slow feedback from tests
  + Prototyping
+ Steep learning curve
+ How long before it pays off (if at all)?

*** Further Reading

The Pragmatic Programmer
Clean Code

*** Questions

+ What about when requirements/specifications are poorly specified up-front?
+ Is it not good practice to write clean code to start with?

* Day 2

** Manjinder Sandhu - Building Stronger Communities in Research Software

+ Attitude and motivation (enjoyment) are more important than being "smart" or "clever".
+ Being fundamentally interested in what you do is very important.
+ Academia you have an idea you do the research and publish it, but there is often a clear, hard outcome of the work.

*** On Genomics

+ Many years ago we had a lot of genetic associations but as we charactersed the genome better we could understand
  humans at greater scale (i.e. greater capturing of the variation from larger sample sizes).
+ Started working very early on in a collaborative way with groups working together.
+ Statistical challenge of multiple testing required larger samples sizes and replication.
+ Still need to validate but scaling is still on-going across academia as well as in pharamceutical industry.
+ Need frameworks for handling million and millions of data points on millions of people, this presents challenges on
  how to handle and manage the large amount of data.
+ How to capitalise on ability to capitalise on the discovery this affords. It was often very biased towards western
  society.
+ Population genetic structure through bottlenecks and expansion and genetic drift afford the opportunity to investigate
  in different populations.
+ Characterise populations better, 1000 genomes project. Led him to population history.
+ Build resources that show the genetic structure of populations and how they relate to each other.
+ Characterise diverse populations, look at divergence, admixture and population history. [[https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/202/4/1485/5930214?login=true][F-statistics for population
  history]].
+ Build research resources for communities worked with institutes, e.g. in Uganda building collaborative networks for
  research software engineering and infrastructure in Uganda, funded by Sanger Centre. Built in UK, then shipped!!!
+ Data centre built, had networking put into the infrastructure that was being rebuilt at that time.
+ Centre is now self-supported within the country.
+ [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36388767/][Uganda Genome Resource]]
+ [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0194-3][Insights from Ugandan genomes]]
+ [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06370-4][Africa-specific human genetic variation near CHD1L associates with HIV-1 load | Nature]] increased expression of this
  gene dampens the ability of the virus to incorporate into the genome.
+ Built a resource, shared with a community and emerging from this was the ability to develop new tools for
  understanding population histories.

*** Democratising Technology for Research

+ Make computing environments flexible.
+ Trusted Research Environments allow large scale data sharing across regions.
+ Align data governance including research compliance, ethics approvals and regulatry and level requirements.
+ Secure, scalable and compliant trusted research environments.
+ Ongoing development of research software including machine/deep learning and "AI".
+ Traditional statistical models have often proved as effective as newer fancier "machine learning" solutions.

** Emerging Voices Plenary

*** Deborah Udoh

+ Universities strikes affected graduation timelines, this changed Deborahs life, YouTube and Stackoverflow accessed via
  her sisters computer. Started doing web-development.
+ Started contributing to JupyterHub, Layer5, publiclab.org, Outrecahy and got a job with [[https://we-are-ols.org/][OLS]].
+ Registered nurse and soon to be a Midwife and Public Health Nurse.
+ Also Carpentries Instructor.
+ Don't see...
  + Lower class large family.
  + Societal expectations
  + Patriarchy
  + Internet Access
  + Power cuts
  + Self-doubt
+ Pursuing psychology and research software engineering and combine the two.
+ Prioritising more young women from underrepresented backgrounds to enter the tech field, developing Research 101 -
+ https://npdebs.github.io/Pre-seeds-Program

*** Jack Atkinson

+ Research application motivates him.
+ Got a title of "careful coder", why was everyone writing their own code to solve their solutions, better software and
  sharing there of would allow for better research.
+ Can RSEs do research? Yes, they can, most have a background of research.
+ Should RSEs do research? Not just working on others problems but using domain and software knowledge to solve
  problems. Only with an understanding of how the software works can researchers often be the most effective,
  understanding and making links that others may not see.
+ Having a presence helps communicate RSE concepts to the intended audience, e.g. domain specific conferences.
+ Not advocating for isolation, reason here today is because of other people.
+ RSE skills self-taught, didn't know what he didn't know, the people he worked with shared their knowledge and
  experience and support when having problems.
+ *How can RSE groups reach out and include those more isolated RSEs within their local institution?*

*** Publication System Could be Improved

+ Academic research is still communicated via PDFs which is just digital paper.
+ Typically take a snapshot of code/website, put it on Zenodo and get a DOI.
+ Papers should be snapshots of code, and published results can and should change.
+ Continuous Integration of papers with their code, go from a paper to the code. Link directly data processing area to
  the functions/code, the same with the statistical analysis.

** Ann Gledson and Adrian Harwood - Agile methods for RSEs : A formula for scrum-driven software development in research?

[[https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide][The Scrum Guide]]

+ Wanted a consistent method of managing "customer" relations, Adrian had been using Agile and SCRUM and wanted to roll
  it out to the rest of the RSE team.

*** Agile and Srum Overview

+ Methodology for project/product management built on a set of values. The Agile manigesto defines the values...
  + Customer collaboration over contact negitiation
  + Responding to change over following a plan
  + Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  + Working software over comprehensive documentation
+ Many implementations of the manifesto and its values.
  + Scrum
  + Extreme Programming

*** Waterfall
+ Requirements > Panning/Design > Implementation > Testing > Feedback
+ Very slow, things change and move fast (both requirements and solutions).
+ Original requirements are no longer valid at the end of the project.
+ Process is eecuted once for the entire project.

*** Scrum

+ Iterative process in short sprints where feedback is constant and modifies the requirements (closes loop in the
  above).
+ Stakeholders have a vestered interest in product, researches and end users do puser acceptance testing.
+ Product owner is the mediator between stakeholder and development team
+ Development Team 2-9 people, cross-functional domain expertise, self-organising and determine together the best way yo
  complete the work.
+ Scrum Master coordinates between those involved ensuring Scrum methodology is followed.
+ Product Backlog is a list of all work to be done to deliver the product. Managed by the Prodct Onwer.
  + New Features, enhancements and bug fixes.
  + Can be written as User Stories.
  + A good issue has a clear definition of done.
+ Living document items can be added, removed, r-ordered and evolve.
+ Sprint Backlog is items to be worked on in the next sprint as agreed by the Development Team.
  + Product Onwer can not add to it, its solely managed by the development team.
  + Product Baclkog is broken down into smaller items then moved onto the Sprint Backlog.

*** Product to Sprint Backlog

+ Sprint planning is chaired by the Scrum Master, get agreed highest-priority items to define sprint goals.
+ Developers then populate the sprint back log by assigning story points which define how much work/value a task has.

*** Daily Stand-Up

+ Attended by all scrum team members 2-4 minutes each, what you did the day before, what you plan to do and issues

*** Sprint Review

+ Attended by Scrum Team and Stakeholders, chaired by Product Owner.
+ Demo showcasing achievements of the sprint.
+ Opportunity for questions to be raised
+ Does the product meet the requirements.
+ Refine for the next sprint.
+ Sprint Retrospectives review the process and NOT the work.

*** Adaptation of Scrum for RSE

+ Rarely know what the outcome will be in research, evolution fo requirements and priorities and need a process
  that deals with this environment.
+ Fail fast Regular feedback miimises risk.
+ Small teams often cross-functional
+ Focus on a sunset of tasks for complex tasks.
+ Clear roles and expectations
+ Clear history, progress and plans always visible to thos involved in the project.
+ Eliminates the "bus factor" (if tools like GitHub projects are used.)

See picture of differences between Scrum and RSE

+ Product Owner
+ Scrum Master
+ RSEs + Postdocs + Phds = Development Team
+ PRoduct Backlog
+ Sprint Backlog
+ Kanban
+ Sprint Planning
+ Stand Ups (not daily)
+ SPrint Review

See picture of grid based on size of RSEs involved.

+ Use GitHub Projects, they are ready to run configuration.
+ LIves side by side  with the code.
+ Most Scrum functionality is available (or configurable).

*** Measures and Metrics

**** Senior RSEs
+ Felt it improved efficiency.
+ Allowed project owners to get involved and add issues to Kanban.
+ Fosters communication.
+ Some pushed back and felt it was an overhead.
**** RSEs
+ Navigated ambiguity and managed stakeholder expectations
+ Common language.
+ Weren't derailed by a "surprise" change in requirements, time boxing useful.
**** Customers
+ Most asked thought it was excellent, felt that completing sprints was an achievement.
+ Transparency of issue tracking.
+ Loved the ability to dynamically adjust priorities (leader got really involved).

**** Summary
+ Complex things are easier to handle and easier to manage changes in requirements.
+ Commits reduced across the RSE team, but the number of issues increased as did the number of pull requests (people are
  doing work in smaller chunks).
+ Senior tended to make more issues.

*** Key Points
+ Rse service requiresw a consistent yet fleixble management approach
Agile methodologies embrace continuous change
Make doing it easy

** Navigating the Legal Landscape : From Research to Commercial Software

*** Data Protection laws and Compliance in Computer Software

+ UK GDPR
+ Ignoring it can lead to disruption to important activities, reputational damage potential monetary loss. Want
  software to be used, data is potentially valuable.
+ Organisational responsibility.

+ Seven GDPR Principles...
  + Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency
  + Purpose limitation
  + Data minimisation
  + Accuracy
  + Storage limitation
  + Integrity and confidentiality (security)
  + Accountability
+ Security
  + Dependabot
  + Container Scanners which report on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
+ Cookies
  + Use institutions template.
+ Data leakage
  + Don't forget logs (e.g. log4j vulnerability)
  + Monitoring tools such as Sentry, Prometheus, Loki
  + Data transfers between jurisdictions
  + Code repositories
  + Backups need careful checking too, especially if going off site, encrypt.
+ Institutions
  + Data Protection Offiers
  + Information Security team
  + Head of Deparment
  + Data Management Plan should have details of how to handle this.
  + Freedom of Information is also something to consider.

*** Personal Identifying Information

+ Any information connected to a speific individual that can be used to uncover that individuals identity.
+ Sharing PII can be valuable to both legal and illegal actors.
+ Examples
  + Social Security / National Insurance Number
  + Drivers license/ passport
  + Biometric data on phones
  + Financial information
  + Postal address, date of birth, gender
  + Genetic Information
  + Medical records via accession number
  + Email address
**** Handling

+ Users of system should use authentication services such as Auth0m ORCID, SSO)
+ Anonymise the data
+ Be careful about PII getting into logs, monitoring services.

**** Anonymising Data
+ Mapping file to replace IDs with UUIDs and keep the mapping file secure and isolated (e.g. encrypted)
+ Browser plugins to convert anonymised ID to PII ID if required, does this in HTML in the ed-suers browser.

**** Useful
+ Explaining outliers
+ Follow up questions
+ Demographic Analysis
+ Longitudinal Studies
+ Linking data sets
+ Social and economic studies
+ Importance of PII is only going to increase need informed consent.

*** Software Licenses and Intellectual Property

+ Always check license free and open...
  + Public domain (creative Commons)
  + Permissive (MIT Apache, MPL BSD)
  + Copyleft (GPL AGPL)

+ AGPL is  a problem, if you make changes you have to distribute them.
+ MongoDB Server Side Public License caused problems when changes were made.

**** Intellectual Property
+ "Intangible creations of the human intellect"
+ Can be complex and therefore takes time
+ Useful to have the support of a good tech transfer team
+ Have to complete an invention record to explain what you have done and who was involved.

** RSE Competencies Toolkit
+ Started SSI Collaborations Workshop Hack Day in May 2023
+ Been lots of interest at events since.
+ *Motivation* It can be difficult for RSEs to understand what skills they need to succeed.
+ Help RSEs to measure skills, plan their professional development and understand training paths.
+ Lots of competencies frameworks out there but RSEs have quite specific requirements and needs so it needs to be
  flexible which also allows the tool to be transferable to other domains.

+ Databases store data
+ They do so in a structured manner to ensure data is consistent and easily retrievable.
+ Excel is not a database, it messes with your data without you knowing about it.
+ The most popular database in the world is [[https://www.sqlite.org/index.html][SQLite]] it provides a single standalone file to everything required for a
  database.
+ It is designed to be a backend to other programmes

*** Useful Tools

+ [[https://qgis.org/][Spatial without Compromise · QGIS Web Site]] which is a graphical front-end to SQL(ite) databases.
  + Makes it very easy to create databases via a GUI with limitations on fields, e.g. matching RegEx.
  + It understands relationships
+ [[https://datasette.io/][Datasette]] publishes data to the web where it can easily browsed without having to know any coding.
  + Makes it very easy to combine datasets.
+ [[https://britishgeologicalsurvey.github.io/etlhelper/][ETL Helper]] helps with moving data between databases.
  + See [[https://volcan01010.github.io/RSECon24/index.html#/3/10][examples]].
