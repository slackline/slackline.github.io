#+TITLE: NixOS - Configuration
#+FILETAGS: :nixos:linux:config:

There is a /lot/ to configuring everything, here I break things down a bit, there is some overlap with both [[id:c9eb0e6d-b152-487c-90d4-3786fcfd0889][Flakes]] and
[[id:01336e19-dc8a-41ca-8534-6a790b39b1b6][HomeManager]] since some aspects of configuration are delegated to these systems. It helps to understand the Nix language
and a good starting point is the [[https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language][Nix language basics tutorial]].

* Fingerprint

The laptop I've installed NixOS on (a ThinkPad T490 i7-8865U @ 1.90Ghz with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSH) has a fingerprint
scanner as well as a touch screen. The [[https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Fingerprint_scanner][fingerprint]] scanner can be used to unlock the laptop. To enable add the following
~service~

#+begin_src
services = {
  ...
  fprintd = {
    enable = true;
  };
};
#+end_src

You will have to at the very least ~nixos-rebuild test~ to load the new configuration and you can then used
~fprintd-enroll~ to register the finger print.
